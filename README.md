### What is verified today

- **6,070 workspace tests are listed** by `cargo test --workspace -- --list`; CI Gate 2 runs them in debug and release modes
- **Build succeeds** for all library crates, binaries, tests, and benchmarks
- **Clippy clean** under `-D warnings` for all workspace targets
- **Format clean** under `cargo +nightly fmt --all -- --check`
- **23 numbered CI quality gates** plus the required "All Constitutional Gates" aggregator are defined and enforced
- **Traceability matrix** maps 119 requirements — see `governance/traceability_matrix.md`
- **Threat model** covers 17 threats tracked: 17 implemented, 0 partial, 0 planned — see `governance/threat_matrix.md`
- **Constitutional invariants** are enforced in the tested gatekeeper and decision-forum adjudication paths
- **No floating-point arithmetic** — denied workspace-wide via `#[deny(clippy::float_arithmetic)]`
- **Post-Quantum signatures** — NIST FIPS 204 ML-DSA-65 (CRYSTALS-Dilithium) via `ml-dsa` 0.1.0-rc.7, fully wired in `Signature::PostQuantum` and `Signature::Hybrid` with deterministic signing, tamper-rejection tests, proptest roundtrip coverage, and RUSTSEC-2025-0144 patch

### What is supported by design but not yet production-hardened

- **Scoped 90% coverage threshold** — configured in CI via cargo-tarpaulin and `tarpaulin.toml`; the default coverage gate explicitly excludes runtime adapters, WASM bridge bindings, and proof modules
- **exo-gateway binary** — operational HTTP server with 28 endpoints (REST, GraphQL, health probes); production hardening ongoing
- **GraphQL API** — types and schema definitions exist in `exo-api`; async runtime integration pending
- **exo-dag benchmark** — disabled; needs rewrite against current API

### In Progress

- Continuous governance monitoring via ExoForge — schema, API, threat model, and traceability complete (EXOCHAIN-REM-009); ExoForge scheduled trigger and React health dashboard pending

### Roadmap / Planned

- First versioned release (see `.github/workflows/release.yml` for the dry-run workflow)
- CycloneDX SBOM generation and SLSA supply-chain attestation are configured in CI/release workflows; published release artifacts are not claimed until a GitHub Release exists
- Agent passport API and trust receipt endpoints on exo-node
- National AI Policy Framework compliance extensions

## Autonomous Volition Credentials and the zero-priced economy

EXOCHAIN now ships two additional core crates:

- [`crates/exo-avc`](crates/exo-avc/) — **AVC** (Autonomous Volition
  Credential) is a portable, signed, machine-verifiable credential that
  declares what an autonomous actor is authorized to pursue before it
  acts. Validation is fail-closed and deterministic. Delegation
  strictly narrows scope. See [`docs/avc/README.md`](docs/avc/README.md).
- [`crates/exo-economy`](crates/exo-economy/) — the custody-native
  settlement scaffold. Quotes, settlements, revenue-share lines, and
  hash-chained settlement receipts run end-to-end. The launch policy
  resolves every active price to **zero** with an explicit
  `ZeroFeeReason`, so trust is never paywalled. See
  [`docs/economy/README.md`](docs/economy/README.md).

The two layers are **independent**: AVC validity does not consult
pricing or settlement state, and the economy layer never gates trust on
payment availability. Future governance amendments can switch nonzero
pricing on by policy without modifying AVC validation.

HonorGood and Apex Velocity Catalyst Mission Economics now live in
`exo-economy` as core provenance and settlement primitives: Missions,
Contribution Receipts, Legacy Receipts, Value Contribution Nodes,
Offers, Acceptances, Bailment Wrappers, Rulesets, and Mission
Settlements. `exo-node` records these objects through `/api/v1/economy/*`
with durable canonical-CBOR storage and `EconomyRecordAnchor` hash links.
The Rust SDK, TypeScript SDK, and WASM bridge expose stable core economy
types/routes/anchor helpers. CommandBase is the cockpit adapter; ExoForge
is the factory adapter; EXOCHAIN core remains the settlement authority.
Canonical docs are under
[`docs/honorgood/HONOR_GOOD_COMPACT.md`](docs/honorgood/HONOR_GOOD_COMPACT.md)
and
[`docs/economy/AVC_MISSION_ECONOMICS_COMPACT.md`](docs/economy/AVC_MISSION_ECONOMICS_COMPACT.md).
Here `exo-avc` remains Autonomous Volition Credential; Apex Velocity
Catalyst is named explicitly.

## Architecture

```
Layer 1: CGR Kernel         (Rust, 31 crates, 374769 tracked LOC under crates/)
         Constitutional governance runtime — deterministic, no floats,
         production Ed25519/BLAKE3 cryptography plus unaudited pedagogical
         SNARK/STARK/ZKML skeletons, 6,070 listed workspace tests

Layer 2: WASM Bridge        (packages/exochain-wasm/)
         165 verified WASM exports covered by 172 bridge checks — Rust -> WebAssembly -> JavaScript

Layer 3: CommandBase.ai     (command-base/)
         Adjacent cockpit adapter for cognitiveplane.ai
         Control surfaces, GSD buttons, and governance receipts
         EXOCHAIN trust claims require a tested core API or verified adapter path
         Express/Node.js + SQLite + WebSocket

Layer 4: Decision Forum     (web/)
         Governance deliberation UI
         React/Vite — decisions, delegations, audit, constitution

Layer 5: ExoForge           (exoforge/)
         Governance triage, planning, validation, and monitoring tools
         Triage → Council-style heuristic review → Plan → Constitutional Validation
```

## The Five Axioms

1. **Identity Adjudication** — Decentralized identity with cryptographic proof, not administrative fiat.
2. **Data Sovereignty** — Data belongs to its subject; consent is explicit, revocable, and auditable.
3. **Deterministic Finality** — Every operation is reproducible and verifiable; no floating-point arithmetic permitted.
4. **Constitutional Governance** — System behavior is governed by the constitutional specification and draft CR-001 AEGIS/SYBIL framework pending council ratification.
5. **Authentic Plurality** — Sybil-resistant participation ensuring one-entity-one-voice integrity.

## Repository Structure

### DAG DB Runtime Adapter

This PR package uses upstream `exochain/exochain` as the substrate and adds DAG
DB as a graph-governed memory runtime adapter. Runtime ownership is split across
[`crates/exo-dag-db-api`](crates/exo-dag-db-api/),
[`crates/exo-dag-db-core`](crates/exo-dag-db-core/),
[`crates/exo-dag-db-graph`](crates/exo-dag-db-graph/),
[`crates/exo-dag-db-domain`](crates/exo-dag-db-domain/),
[`crates/exo-dag-db-retrieval`](crates/exo-dag-db-retrieval/),
[`crates/exo-dag-db-exchange`](crates/exo-dag-db-exchange/),
[`crates/exo-dag-db-postgres`](crates/exo-dag-db-postgres/), and
[`crates/exo-dag-db-lab`](crates/exo-dag-db-lab/), with shipped docs in
[`docs/dagdb`](docs/dagdb/). The upstream substrate should remain synchronized
with `exochain/exochain`; DAG DB bridge points live in `exo-api`, `exo-gateway`,
`exo-node`, and `exochain-sdk`.

The production REST runtime mounts exactly `POST /api/v1/dag-db/route`,
`POST /api/v1/dag-db/context-packet`, `POST /api/v1/dag-db/writeback`,
`POST /api/v1/dag-db/import`, and `POST /api/v1/dag-db/export`:
`exo-gateway` defaults compile the `production-db` path, and `exo-node` defaults
inherit that gateway feature set. Runtime database configuration remains
explicit; missing Postgres state, tenant authority, or write signatures fail
closed instead of fabricating persistence. The node MCP/SDK gateway proxy is a
separate feature-gated configured-proxy evidence path, not an additional mounted
REST surface.

#### Current `exo-dag-db` status

`exo-dag-db` is **deterministic, graph-governed cross-agent retention and recall
with measured context compression.** Agents draw bounded, citation-carrying
context packets selected by deterministic graph policies (placement classifier,
layer creation, integer-bp selection scoring) — never by agent judgment — and
write provenance-preserving memories back without loading the whole repository.
Narrow input-token compression probes measure roughly 95–99% reduction on the
selected slice. This is what the component is delivered to do.

`exo-dag-db` does **not** yet claim to be *cheaper AND better* than raw context —
the core thesis is measured and **not** met. The rigorous 12-task benchmark
(HEAD `a3279281`, 2026-06-14, blinded judge) records governed grounding `5,958`
bp, which **reaches but does not exceed** the `6,250` bp full-packet plateau;
cost-vs-neutral `0` bp (**FAIL** — governed input tokens dwarf the no-memory
arm); input-token savings vs raw `27.1%` (**FAIL** vs the `80%` floor); blinded
verdict `0-7-5` (governed won zero head-to-heads); and governed hallucinates more
than raw (`1,292` bp unsupported claims vs raw `542` bp). End-to-end dollar
savings are **not_calculable** (no provider billing receipts), and answer quality
is **at best a tie**. The thesis proof gate returns **not_accepted**.

The runtime activation claim is bounded to the governed gateway REST paths,
tenant-bound Postgres persistence, and configured node MCP/SDK gateway proxy
evidence described in
[`INTEGRATION.md`](INTEGRATION.md). Operator rollout sequencing, canary rollback,
and production observability are tracked in the DAG DB runtime activation runbook:
[`docs/dagdb/runtime-activation/rollback-canary-observability.md`](docs/dagdb/runtime-activation/rollback-canary-observability.md).
These runtime docs do not claim billing savings or thesis acceptance.

3. **Process**: All PRs should map to a Spec requirement. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for AI-assisted development.

## Post-Quantum Cryptography

EXOCHAIN uses a `Signature` enum supporting three modes:

* **Ed25519** — Current default for signing and verification
* **PostQuantum** — NIST FIPS 204 ML-DSA-65 (CRYSTALS-Dilithium). Production-wired.
* **Hybrid** — Combined Ed25519 + ML-DSA-65. Strict AND verification (no short-circuit). Closes the silent Ed25519-only downgrade (EXOCHAIN-REM-005).

Float arithmetic is denied workspace-wide via `#[deny(clippy::float_arithmetic)]`.
