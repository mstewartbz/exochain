  {
    q: 'Is EXOCHAIN a cryptocurrency?',
    a: 'No. EXOCHAIN is a custody-native blockchain. The economic layer ships the transaction mechanism, but the launch policy resolves every active price to zero. There is no token sale and no investment offering.'
  },
  {
    q: 'Does EXOCHAIN claim AI has consciousness?',
    a: 'No. The word "volition" in AVC is operational and delegated. It refers to the authorized intent a principal hands to a subject; it is not a claim about machine sentience.'
  },
  {
    q: 'Can AVC validation be slowed by network congestion or pricing changes?',
    a: 'No. Validation is independent of the economy and runs deterministically against the AVC, the parent chain, and the policy in effect.'
  },
  {
    q: 'What happens to receipts after I revoke an AVC?',
    a: 'They remain. Receipts issued before revocation continue to be valid evidence of the authorization that existed at execution time. Future actions under the revoked AVC fail-closed.'
  },
  {
    q: 'Is the network production-ready?',
    a: 'No. EXOCHAIN is in alpha. Validator membership, attestation, and pricing policy are all subject to change. See the Trust Center for current capabilities and the public roadmap.'
