          Identity systems prove who an actor is. Access controls decide what
          they can call. Logs record what they did. None of these, alone or
          together, give boards, auditors, regulators, or counterparties what
          they actually need: an evidentiary chain that ties a specific
          autonomous action to a specific delegated authority, with consent,
          policy, and revocation state preserved.

                Knowing an agent is who it claims to be is the start of
                accountability, not the end. An identified agent operating

                authorized scope.

                A finance leader delegates an agent to purchase office goods up

                delegation chain. Revocation at any layer cascades.
