          In evidentiary contexts, chain-of-custody is the documentation that
          shows who held an item, when, and under what authority — preserved
          unbroken from origin to use. EXOCHAIN extends that discipline to
          autonomous action.

                and revocation state in effect when the action occurred.

            Revocation is a first-class operation on the credential graph.
            When an issuer revokes an AVC, every credential derived from it
            inherits the revocation. Already-issued receipts remain as
            evidence of past authorization; future actions under the revoked
            credential fail-closed at validation.
