          <p>
            Trust receipts always exist when an authorized autonomous action
            occurs. Settlement receipts exist when the economic layer is
            invoked. The two layers are independent: AVC validity does not
            consult pricing, and settlement issuance does not gate trust.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under the launch policy, every settlement receipt carries
            <code> amount = 0 EXO</code> with an explicit{' '}
            <code>ZeroFeeReason</code>. The transaction mechanism is live,
            preserved for the day governance enables nonzero pricing.
