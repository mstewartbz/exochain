        <h2>What we collect</h2>
        <p>
          For the public site we collect minimal request metadata required
          to operate the service. We do not run third-party advertising
          trackers. Analytics, when added, will be privacy-preserving and
          documented in the Trust Center before deployment.
        </p>
        <h2>Authenticated surfaces</h2>
        <p>
          Account information is what you provide at sign-up: email, role,
          organization. API key usage is logged for security and rate
          limiting.
        </p>
        <h2>Data subject requests</h2>
        <p>
          Contact <code>privacy@exochain.io</code> for access, correction,
          or deletion requests. We will respond within timelines required
          by applicable law.
        </p>
