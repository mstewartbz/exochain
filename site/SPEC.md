# EXOCHAIN Web Presence — Specification

**Document status:** v1.0 — initial scoping and MVP build plan
**Scope:** Public website, authenticated extranet, internal intranet
**Owners:** EXOCHAIN product, protocol, and operations leads
**Posture:** Alpha. Nothing on this site claims production decentralization, regulatory approval, or completed audit unless explicitly backed by published artifacts.

---

## 1. Positioning

**Primary headline:** EXOCHAIN is chain-of-custody for autonomous execution.

**Subheadline:** Credential autonomous intent, verify delegated authority, and preserve evidentiary custody for agents, holons, humans, and AI-native systems.

**Frame to keep in mind:** *Credentialed volition. Evidentiary execution. Chain-of-custody for autonomous systems.*

EXOCHAIN is a custody-native blockchain. Blockchain is the mechanism. Chain-of-custody is the purpose. EXOCHAIN preserves custody of what autonomous actors actually do. AVC (Autonomous Volition Credential) credentials what an autonomous actor is authorized to pursue.

The economic layer is **zero-priced launch settlement**: the transaction mechanism exists, quotes and receipts can be issued, but every active price resolves to zero with an explicit `ZeroFeeReason` until governance amends the policy.

---

## 2. Three surfaces at a glance

| Surface | Audience | Auth | Domain (proposed) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Internet** | Public — developers, enterprises, researchers, regulators, press, candidates | None | `exochain.io` | Authoritative public narrative, docs, trust center, status |
| **Extranet** | Authenticated external users — devs, customers, partners, validators, auditors, agent operators | OIDC + role | `app.exochain.io` | Issue AVCs, validate, view custody trails, run nodes, export audit packets |
| **Intranet** | Internal EXOCHAIN operators, maintainers, governance, security, support, legal | OIDC + SSO + role + step-up MFA | `internal.exochain.io` | Network ops, governance controls, pricing policy, content, incidents |

All three surfaces are served by a single Next.js app behind a CDN, with hard route separation enforced by middleware and a session-scoped role check at the layout boundary. In production, the three host names should resolve to separate Vercel/Cloud Run deployments with distinct environment variables and access policies.

---

## 3. Brand and voice

- Serious, technical, trustworthy, future-forward, institution-grade.
- *Evidentiary trust substrate*, not crypto startup. *Custody and accountability*, not AI buzzword. *Protocol and governance infrastructure*, not dashboard SaaS.
- Clear enough for developers. Credible enough for boards, auditors, insurers, legal teams, and regulators. Inspiring enough for autonomous-systems researchers and AI-native venture builders.
- **Avoid leading with:** crypto, token, speculation, DeFi, Web3 hype, AI wrapper, generic agent platform, generic automation platform.
- **Avoid imagery:** neon crypto clichés, generic AI robot art, glowing cubes, glitch fonts.
- **Use imagery:** custody trails, chains, credentials, receipts, command/control surfaces, network nodes, evidence packets, restrained line diagrams.

### 3.1 Vocabulary (use consistently)

EXOCHAIN · Autonomous Volition Credential · AVC · chain-of-custody · custody-native blockchain · autonomous execution · evidentiary execution · trust receipt · settlement receipt · delegated authority · agent identity · holon · consent · revocation · custody verifier · governance · policy enforcement · zero-priced launch settlement · custody fabric · agent economy · human trust layer · machine-readable trust.

### 3.2 Conceptual one-liners

- Blockchain is the mechanism. Chain-of-custody is the purpose.
- AVC credentials intent. EXOCHAIN receipts execution.
- Identity proves who an actor is. AVC proves what it may pursue.
- Trust is not paywalled. Value-bearing autonomous execution can be metered later.
- EXOCHAIN turns autonomous action into evidentiary custody.

## 6. Page-by-page content outline

### 6.1 Internet

#### `/` Home
- Hero: headline + subheadline + two primary CTAs (`/developers`, `/contact`).
- Architecture band: Identity → Authority → Volition → Consent → Execution → Custody Receipt.
- Three-pillar block: AVC explainer · Trust receipt explainer · Zero-priced launch settlement explainer.
- "Blockchain is the mechanism. Chain-of-custody is the purpose." callout.
- Three CTAs by audience: Developers · Enterprises · Validators / Researchers.
- Status strip: alpha · network mode · last release · public status link.
- Footer with full sitemap, legal, brand, contact.

#### `/why`
- Problem: autonomous systems can act faster than institutions can verify authority.
- Gap: identity alone is not enough; access control alone is not enough; logs alone are not enough.
- Solution: chain-of-custody for autonomous execution.
- Worked examples: a delegated trade, a delegated procurement action, a delegated medical workflow assist (each as a small narrative, never reproducing third-party content).

#### `/chain-of-custody`
- What chain-of-custody means in evidentiary contexts (general, then technical).
- How EXOCHAIN extends it to autonomous execution.
- Diagram: human → AVC → agent → EXOCHAIN → trust receipt → revocation/extension cycle.
- Distinction between chain (sequence) and custody (responsibility).

#### `/avc`
- Definition: AVC is a portable, signed, machine-verifiable credential that declares what an autonomous actor is authorized to pursue **before** it acts.
- Identity vs. authority vs. volition vs. execution.
- Important disclaimer: AVC does not claim consciousness or human-like will. *Volition* here is delegated operational intent, scoped and revocable.
- Worked examples: human → agent, enterprise → department agent, agent → child agent, holon participation, revocation cascade.
- Validity is fail-closed and deterministic. Delegation strictly narrows scope.

#### `/trust-receipts`
- Definition: a trust receipt is a hash-chained, signed record proving identity, authority, consent, policy, action, timestamp, revocation state, and custody hash for a single execution event.
- Sample receipt fields with annotated JSON.
- Trust receipt vs. settlement receipt: trust receipts always exist; settlement receipts exist when the economic layer is invoked.

#### `/custody-native-blockchain`
- The blockchain mechanism is preserved. The "chain" is reframed as chain-of-custody.
- Validators are *custody verifiers*. Block production is custody attestation, not just transaction ordering.
- Determinism, post-quantum readiness, constitutional governance, no floating-point arithmetic.
- Zero-priced launch settlement: every active price resolves to zero with explicit `ZeroFeeReason`.

#### `/developers`
- Quickstart: install the SDK, register an actor, issue an AVC, validate, generate a trust receipt, generate a zero settlement quote, fetch a settlement receipt.
- SDK matrix (Rust today; Node/TypeScript and Python on the roadmap).
- API surface overview, links to `/api` and `/docs`.
- Run-a-node link (`/node`) and validator guide (`/docs/validator-guide`).
- GitHub link placeholder.

#### `/docs`
- Sidebar navigation across the 11 doc sections.
- Each doc page is a structured Markdown document rendered through MDX in a future iteration; in the MVP, doc pages are hand-authored TSX.
- Mark unstable APIs clearly with an "Unstable" pill.

#### `/api`
- Embeds an OpenAPI viewer (Swagger UI / Redocly) once `exo-gateway` ships its public OpenAPI document. Until then, link to spec snapshot in `/docs/node-api`.

#### `/node`
- What an EXOCHAIN node is. Operator vs. validator roles.
- Hardware and network expectations. Attestation requirements for validators (placeholder copy until verified).
- Where to onboard: `/app/validators`.

#### `/trust-center`
- Security posture, threat model link (link to public summary, full matrix internal).
- Cryptographic assumptions: ML-DSA-65 (CRYSTALS-Dilithium) signatures, hybrid signature support, deterministic signing.
- Responsible disclosure policy.
- Audit readiness statement (current capabilities vs. roadmap, clearly distinguished).
- Compliance roadmap (SOC 2 Type I/II, ISO 27001, NIST AI RMF mapping — listed as roadmap items, not claims of certification).
- Privacy and data-custody posture.
- Zero-priced launch policy (with link to `/internal/pricing-policy` for operators only).
- Status link.

#### `/security`
- Threat model summary, public bug bounty intent (placeholder).
- Coordinated disclosure email, PGP key, scope statement.

#### `/governance`
- Constitutional invariants (governance kernel summary).
- How protocol changes happen (proposal lifecycle, quorum, ratification).
- Where governance lives in the codebase (link to public governance documents in `governance/`).

#### `/research`
- Whitepapers index with abstracts.
- Technical notes index.
- Governance and agent-economy papers as published.

#### `/status`
- Network mode banner: `alpha · testnet · pre-release`.
- Node count placeholder, validator count placeholder, peer count placeholder, last committed height placeholder.
- Uptime widgets per service: gateway, node API, docs, status itself.
- Known incidents list with severity and resolution state. **No fake green checks.** When metrics are mocked, label them `mock`.

#### `/blog`
- Reverse-chron list. Posts are MDX in `/web/content/blog`.

#### `/contact`
- Early access form: name, email, role, organization, intended use, anti-spam.
- Press contact, partnership contact, security contact (links to `/security`).

#### `/brand`
- Logo lockups, color tokens, typography, do/don't usage.

#### `/legal/privacy` and `/legal/terms`
- Boilerplate placeholder authored by counsel before public launch. Not production legal text.

### 6.2 Extranet (`/app`)

Each extranet page presents the same shell (left rail nav, top bar with org switcher and role badge, content area, audit log drawer).

**Dashboard (`/app`)** — counts: active AVCs, active actors, recent trust receipts, recent settlement quotes, pricing-policy banner ("Zero-priced launch settlement is in effect"), API health pill.

**Org profile (`/app/org`)** — org details, verified domains, designated issuer scope, default policy domain, designated auditors.

**Actors (`/app/actors`)** — table over `Actor` records with type filter (human/org/agent/holon/service/validator). Actions: register, deactivate, view trust trail.

**AVCs (`/app/avcs`)** — table over `AVC` records with status filter (active/expired/revoked/quarantined). Detail panel shows scope, parent, expiry, signers, revocation history, derived receipts.

**Issue AVC (`/app/avcs/issue`)** — multi-step form: subject actor → scope (policy domain + actions) → parent delegation (optional) → expiry → policy expressions → review (cryptographic preview of payload) → sign and issue. Generates AVC ID and downloadable JSON.

**Validate AVC (`/app/avcs/validate`)** — paste an AVC token or upload JSON, submit to the validator service, render a structured validation result (PASS / FAIL with deterministic reason codes).

**Revocations (`/app/revocations`)** — list with cause codes, initiator, cascade preview before commit. Revocation requires step-up auth.

**Trust receipts (`/app/trust-receipts`)** — searchable explorer over `TrustReceipt` records. Drill into receipt → custody trail.

**Settlement quotes (`/app/settlement-quotes`)** — generate a quote (always shows `amount = 0` with `ZeroFeeReason: launch_policy_zero`). Visible banner: *Zero-priced launch settlement is in effect. The transaction mechanism is live; pricing is suppressed by policy.*

**Settlement receipts (`/app/settlement-receipts`)** — list of issued receipts; all amounts zero. Clearly distinguishes from trust receipts.

**Custody trails (`/app/custody-trails`)** — given an actor, AVC, or receipt, render the full hash-chained trail with provenance.

**Nodes (`/app/nodes`)** — for `node_operator` role: register a node, view local telemetry (mocked in MVP).

**Validator onboarding (`/app/validators`)** — for `validator_operator` role: hardware attestation upload, key registration, observation period status.

**API keys (`/app/api-keys`)** — create/rotate keys; show key once at creation only. Per-key scopes.

**Webhooks (`/app/webhooks`)** — subscribe to events (AVC.issued, AVC.revoked, TrustReceipt.created, SettlementReceipt.created, etc.) with signed payload verification details.

**Audit exports (`/app/audit-exports`)** — request an audit packet by date range and scope; downloads as a deterministic, signed bundle.

**Policy domains (`/app/policy-domains`)** — registry of declared policy domains the org operates within.

**Consent records (`/app/consent-records`)** — view consent grants attached to AVCs (subject, principal, scope, expiry, revocation status).

**Support (`/app/support`)** and **security requests (`/app/security-requests`)** — ticket submission with severity selector. Security requests are routed to the internal security queue.

**Settings (`/app/settings`)** — user profile, MFA, sessions, notification preferences.

### 6.3 Intranet (`/internal`)

Same shell concept but with stricter chrome (system-status header, environment label, redaction toggles).

**Dashboard (`/internal`)** — health summary, open incidents, security queue depth, pending governance proposals, pricing-policy summary (must show all active prices = 0 with `ZeroFeeReason`).

**Network ops (`/internal/network`)** — gateway status, validator quorum, peer mesh, replication lag.

**Node health (`/internal/nodes`)** — per-node telemetry, alerts.

**Validator registry (`/internal/validators`)** — list of validators, attestation state, slashing history (placeholder).

**Actor registry (`/internal/actors`)** — read-only or quarantine-only over external actors.

**AVC registry (`/internal/avcs`)** — full read access, with redaction defaults; ability to mark suspicious or quarantine where policy allows.

**Revocation console (`/internal/revocations`)** — emergency revocation flow with quorum approval workflow.

**Trust receipt explorer (`/internal/trust-receipts`)** and **settlement explorer (`/internal/settlement`)** — same as extranet, broader scope.

**Pricing policy (`/internal/pricing-policy`)** — current policy state, edit form for future pricing parameters. Active prices remain zero; future config is staged behind a feature flag and a quorum.

**Governance controls (`/internal/governance`)** — open proposals, quorum status, ratification.

**Security review queue (`/internal/security`)** — incoming responsible-disclosure reports, triage, status.

**Incident management (`/internal/incidents`)** — open, update, close, link to public status writes.

**Audit export queue (`/internal/audit`)** — pending packets, signing state, delivery state.

**Content management (`/internal/content`)** — public marketing pages (Home, Why, etc.) editor.

**Documentation management (`/internal/docs-mgmt`)** — docs editor with publish workflow.

**User / org management (`/internal/users`)** — provisioning, deprovisioning, role assignment.

**Support queue (`/internal/support`)** — incoming tickets, owner, SLA.

**Research library (`/internal/research`)** — internal-only drafts, approval workflow before public publish.

**Releases (`/internal/releases`)** — release notes editor, publish workflow.

**Feature flags (`/internal/feature-flags`)** — flags console with environment scoping and audit log.

**System logs (`/internal/logs`)** — searchable, redacted-by-default audit logs.

## 8. Data model (frontend view types)

```ts
// Public types
type Actor = {
  id: string;
  type: 'human' | 'organization' | 'agent' | 'holon' | 'service' | 'validator';
  displayName: string;

  policyDomainId: string;
  scope: { actions: string[]; constraints?: Record<string, unknown> };
  notBefore: string;
  notAfter: string;
  signature: { algorithm: 'ML-DSA-65' | 'Hybrid'; value: string };
  status: 'active' | 'expired' | 'revoked' | 'quarantined';
};

type ConsentRecord = {
  id: string;
  avcId: string;
  principalActorId: string;
  subjectActorId: string;
  grantedAt: string;
  revokedAt?: string;
  scopeHash: string;
};

type TrustReceipt = {
  id: string;
  avcId: string;
  actorId: string;
  policyHash: string;
  actionDescriptor: string;
  outcome: 'permitted' | 'denied' | 'partial';
  custodyHash: string;
  prevHash?: string;
  timestamp: string;
  signature: { algorithm: 'ML-DSA-65'; value: string };
};

type SettlementQuote = {
  id: string;
  avcId: string;
  amount: '0';
  currency: 'EXO';
  zeroFeeReason: 'launch_policy_zero' | 'governance_subsidy' | 'humanitarian_carve_out';
  expiresAt: string;
};

type SettlementReceipt = {
  id: string;
  quoteId: string;
  trustReceiptId: string;
  amount: '0';
  currency: 'EXO';
  zeroFeeReason: SettlementQuote['zeroFeeReason'];
  prevHash?: string;
  timestamp: string;
  signature: { algorithm: 'ML-DSA-65'; value: string };
};

type Revocation = {
  id: string;
  avcId: string;
  cause: 'compromise' | 'scope_change' | 'policy_violation' | 'subject_request' | 'governance_action';
  initiatorActorId: string;
  cascade: string[]; // child AVC ids invalidated
  timestamp: string;
};

type Node = {
  id: string;
  operatorOrgId: string;
  kind: 'node' | 'validator';
  endpoint: string;
  version: string;
  status: 'syncing' | 'healthy' | 'degraded' | 'offline';
  lastHeight?: number;
};

type Incident = {
  id: string;
  severity: 'sev1' | 'sev2' | 'sev3' | 'sev4';
  title: string;
  status: 'open' | 'mitigated' | 'resolved';
  startedAt: string;
  resolvedAt?: string;
  publicSummary?: string;
};
```

All data fields shown to end users must be sourced from typed mocks in `/web/src/lib/mock-data.ts` until the corresponding `exo-gateway` endpoint is wired. Mocked data must be visibly labeled in non-production environments.

---

## 9. Security requirements

- Hard route separation between Internet, Extranet, Intranet via Next.js middleware. Intranet is denied to all sessions whose role is not in the intranet role set, regardless of cookie value.
- Step-up MFA required for: AVC revocation, pricing-policy edits, governance ratification, audit-packet exports, content publish.
- All admin actions write append-only audit log entries (`actor_id`, `scope`, `action`, `target`, `outcome`, `request_id`, `timestamp`).
- No secrets in frontend code. All API calls go through server actions or a backend-for-frontend route handler.
- No private keys in browser storage. Wallet/HSM integration is out of scope for the MVP web layer.
- Public pages must not overstate adoption, decentralization, legal compliance, audit status, or regulatory approval. Where claims are aspirational, a `Roadmap` pill is required.
- Trust Center distinguishes *current capabilities* from *roadmap items* in two clearly-labeled columns.
- Developer docs mark unstable APIs with an `Unstable` pill at the top of the affected section.
- Settlement-related pages must show the zero-pricing banner.
- Status page is the only place public network metrics may appear, and any metric not backed by a live source must be labeled `mock`.

---

## 10. Compliance and disclosures (public copy)

- "EXOCHAIN is in alpha. The protocol, APIs, governance, and economic layer are subject to change without notice."
- "Zero-priced launch settlement is in effect. Every active price resolves to zero with an explicit `ZeroFeeReason`. Future governance amendments may enable nonzero pricing."
- "Statements about cryptographic assumptions reflect implemented primitives at the time of writing. See `/trust-center` for the current attestation."
- "EXOCHAIN does not provide investment, legal, or financial advice. AVCs are operational credentials, not securities."

## 11. MVP vs. expansion roadmap

### 11.1 MVP — must ship in v0

- Polished public Internet site with all sections in §6.1, even where pages are short.
- Authenticated Extranet shell with all routes in §4.2, mock data, no real cryptographic operations yet.
- Internal Intranet shell with all routes in §4.3, mock data, role-based gating enforced by middleware.
- Design system primitives, five SVG diagrams, full nav and footer.
- Zero-pricing language and banners wired throughout settlement views.
- Status page with explicit `mock` labels until the live `exo-gateway` status feed is wired.
- Mock auth (server-side cookie + role) with a clearly-labeled dev login at `/app/login` and `/internal/login`. Replace with real OIDC before any external user is invited.

### 11.2 v0.5 — short follow-up

- Wire `/api` to `exo-gateway` OpenAPI document.
- Wire `/status` to live network metrics.
- Move docs from hand-authored TSX to MDX.
- Add OG images and per-page meta.
- Add structured data (Organization, BreadcrumbList).

### 11.3 v1.0 — production gating

- Real OIDC + WebAuthn for both Extranet and Intranet.
- Step-up MFA enforcement.
- Live AVC issuance/validation against `exo-node`/`exo-gateway`.
- Live trust-receipt generation and settlement-quote/receipt issuance against `exo-economy`.
- Audit-packet generation backed by `exo-economy` settlement-receipt chain and `exo-node` trust-receipt chain.
- Public bug bounty program live.
- SOC 2 Type I readiness statement (with completion evidence) on the Trust Center.

### 11.4 v1.5+ — expansion

- Validator dashboard with live attestation telemetry.
- Holon registry and inter-holon delegation flows.
- Governance proposal authoring tools (extranet) and ratification UI (intranet).
- Multi-region status page with regional roll-up.
- Public-developer "playground" sandbox for AVC issuance/validation.

## 12. Implementation notes

- **Stack:** Next.js 14 (App Router) + React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS. No external UI kit dependency in v0; primitives are hand-authored to keep the brand precise.
- **Routing:** route groups `(internet)`, with `app/` and `internal/` as top-level segments. Middleware enforces auth and role on the `app` and `internal` trees.
- **Auth (MVP):** server-set HTTP-only cookie `exo-session` with `{ userId, role, surface }`. Replaced by OIDC in v0.5.
- **State:** server components by default. Client components only where interactivity is required (forms, drawers, toggles).
- **Styling:** dark and light themes. Restrained palette: ink, slate, vellum, signal-amber, custody-cyan, alert-red. No neon. No glow.
- **Diagrams:** hand-authored SVG so they remain accessible, themeable, and copy-exact. No third-party diagram runtime in v0.
- **Telemetry:** none in v0. Add privacy-preserving telemetry behind a Trust Center disclosure before broad public launch.
- **Build:** standard Next.js build. Deployable to Vercel or any Node 20 host.

## 13. Acceptance criteria for v0

- All Internet routes in §4.1 render and link correctly.
- All Extranet routes in §4.2 render and reflect the role badge.
- All Intranet routes in §4.3 render with the environment banner and redaction defaults.
- Five named diagrams render at all viewports without overflow.
- Zero-pricing banner appears on every settlement-related page.
- Status page shows `mock` labels on every numeric metric.
- Middleware blocks unauthenticated `/app/*` and `/internal/*` requests and redirects to the corresponding login.
- No copy on the public site claims completed audits, regulatory approval, or production decentralization.
- Every administrative action page shows a clear "this writes to the audit log" affordance.
- Build passes with no TypeScript errors and no ESLint errors at `next lint` defaults.

*End of specification. Implementation lives in `/web` as a Next.js application.*
