## 1. Contract Template Engine Architecture

The contract engine introduces clause-based composition to the bailment lifecycle. Rather than hashing raw bytes as `terms_hash`, bailments now reference a **ComposedContract** — a deterministic, content-addressed document built from parameterized clause templates.

**Template Registry.** Each `BailmentType` (Custody, Processing, Delegation, Emergency) has a default `ContractTemplate` containing clauses across eight categories: DataCustody, ProcessingRights, BreachRemedies, LiabilityCaps, DisputeResolution, Termination, Jurisdiction, and Indemnification. Templates are versioned strings (semver). The registry is code-defined (no external storage) — `default_template(BailmentType)` returns the canonical template for each type. Custom templates can be constructed by modifying the default.

**Jurisdiction-Aware Clause Selection.** Clauses carry an optional `jurisdiction: Option<String>`. During composition, if a clause specifies a jurisdiction that doesn't match the contract params' jurisdiction, it is excluded. If a clause has `jurisdiction: None`, it applies universally. This allows templates to contain jurisdiction-specific clauses (e.g., GDPR data residency for "EU", CCPA for "US-CA") alongside universal clauses, with the composition step filtering to the relevant set.

**Data Classification Tiers.** `DataClassification` (Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted, Regulated) affects which clauses are included and how liability caps are assessed. Higher classifications trigger stricter clauses — Restricted/Regulated data mandates encryption-at-rest clauses, breach notification timelines, and elevated liability caps. The classification is a parameter on `ContractParams`, and clause bodies reference `{{data_classification}}` for human-readable rendering.

**Composition is Pure.** `compose()` is a pure function: same template + same params = same `ComposedContract` with identical `contract_hash`. This is constitutionally required — determinism is non-negotiable. All intermediate serialization uses canonical CBOR via `exo_core::hash::hash_structured`.

## 2. Contract Data Model

### Types

```
ContractTemplate → contains Vec<Clause> for a BailmentType
    ↓ compose(template, params)
ComposedContract → rendered clauses, deterministic hash
    ↓ contract_hash
Bailment.terms_hash (existing field, now backed by structured contract)
```

**`Clause`**: Template-level definition. Contains `id`, `category: ClauseCategory`, `title`, `body` (with `{{param}}` placeholders), `required: bool`, and `jurisdiction: Option<String>`. Required clauses must be present in every composition for that template; optional clauses may be jurisdiction-filtered.

**`ContractTemplate`**: Named, versioned collection of clauses for a specific `BailmentType`. The `id` is a stable identifier (e.g., `"custody-standard-v1"`), `name` is human-readable, `version` tracks the template revision.

**`ContractParams`**: All values needed to bind a template into a concrete contract. Includes party names and DIDs, effective/expiry dates (as `Timestamp` — HLC, no std::time), jurisdiction string, `DataClassification`, `liability_cap_bps` (basis points, u64 — no floating point), and `custom_params: DeterministicMap<String, String>` for extensibility.

**`ComposedContract`**: The fully rendered contract. `rendered_clauses: Vec<RenderedClause>` contains each clause with params substituted and section numbers assigned. `contract_hash: Hash256` is the CBOR-canonical hash of all rendered clauses plus params — this value becomes `terms_hash` on the `Bailment` struct. `version: u32` starts at 1, increments on amendments. `parent_contract_id: Option<String>` links amendments to their predecessor.

**`RenderedClause`**: A single clause with all placeholders resolved. `section_number` uses hierarchical numbering (e.g., "1", "2", "3.1") — currently flat by clause index but extensible.

**Relationship to Bailment**: `ComposedContract.contract_hash` is what gets set as `Bailment.terms_hash`. The bailment lifecycle (`propose → accept → active`) remains unchanged. The contract engine sits alongside it: compose a contract, get its hash, pass that hash to `bailment::propose()` as the terms bytes (or directly set `terms_hash`).

## 3. Clause Library

### Standard Clauses by BailmentType

**Custody** (8 clauses — one per category):
- DataCustody: "Bailee shall hold {{bailor_name}}'s data in secure custody without modification..."
- ProcessingRights: "No processing rights are granted. Bailee may only store and return data..."
- BreachRemedies: "Upon breach, {{bailor_name}} shall receive notice within {{breach_notice_days}} days..."
- LiabilityCaps: "Total liability capped at {{liability_cap_bps}} basis points of assessed value..."
- DisputeResolution: "Disputes under jurisdiction {{jurisdiction}} resolved via binding arbitration..."
- Termination: "Either party may terminate with {{termination_notice_days}} days written notice..."
- Jurisdiction: "This agreement governed by laws of {{jurisdiction}}..."
- Indemnification: "{{bailee_name}} shall indemnify {{bailor_name}} against third-party claims..."

**Processing** extends Custody clauses with:
- ProcessingRights: "Bailee may process data for purposes defined in this agreement. Processing scope: {{data_classification}} tier data..."
- Additional breach clauses for unauthorized processing

**Delegation** extends Processing with:
- Sub-delegation terms, chain-of-custody requirements
- Sub-bailee must maintain equivalent or stricter terms

**Emergency** has time-limited variants:
- All clauses include "Emergency access expires {{expiry_date}}..."
- Justification requirements in DataCustody clause
- Elevated audit logging requirements

### Parameterized Clauses

All clause bodies use `{{param_name}}` syntax. Standard parameters: `bailor_name`, `bailee_name`, `bailor_did`, `bailee_did`, `effective_date`, `expiry_date`, `jurisdiction`, `data_classification`, `liability_cap_bps`. Custom parameters from `ContractParams.custom_params` are also substituted.

### Clause Precedence

Required clauses (`required: true`) must always be present. Jurisdiction-specific clauses override universal clauses in the same category when the jurisdiction matches. If multiple clauses share a category, they are all included with sequential section numbers.

## 4. Contract Composition Flow

1. **Bailment Proposed**: Caller determines `BailmentType` and constructs `ContractParams`.
2. **Template Selected**: `default_template(bailment_type)` returns the canonical template. (Future: custom template registry.)
3. **Clauses Filtered**: Clauses with `jurisdiction: Some(j)` where `j != params.jurisdiction` are excluded. Required clauses with mismatched jurisdiction raise an error (constitutional: required clauses cannot be silently dropped).
4. **Parameters Bound**: Each clause body has `{{placeholder}}` strings replaced with concrete values from `ContractParams`. Standard params mapped first, then `custom_params`.
5. **Section Numbers Assigned**: Clauses numbered sequentially: "1", "2", "3", etc.
6. **Contract Hash Computed**: All `RenderedClause` structs plus key params serialized to canonical CBOR, then BLAKE3-hashed → `contract_hash: Hash256`.
7. **`terms_hash` Set**: `contract_hash` bytes passed to `Bailment.terms_hash` — the existing field now has a structured, verifiable backing.
8. **Parties Sign**: Bailment acceptance proceeds via existing `bailment::accept()` with signature.
9. **Contract Active**: The `ComposedContract` is stored alongside the `Bailment` for audit, rendering, and breach assessment.

## 5. Breach Detection & Settlement

### Breach Classification

- **Minor**: Non-material violation of a non-critical clause (e.g., late reporting). Remedy: `Notice`.
- **Material**: Violation of a substantive clause affecting data integrity or processing rights. Remedy: `Cure { cure_period_days: 30 }`.
- **Fundamental**: Violation that destroys trust basis (unauthorized data disclosure, identity fraud). Remedy: `Termination` + `Indemnification { amount_bps }`.

### Assessment Flow

`assess_breach(contract, breached_clause_ids, severity)`:

1. Validate all `breached_clause_ids` exist in the contract's rendered clauses. Unknown clause IDs → error (prevents phantom breach claims).
2. Assess severity against breached clause categories:
   - Minor → `Remedy::Notice`
   - Material → `Remedy::Cure { cure_period_days: 30 }`
   - Fundamental → `Remedy::Termination` if no LiabilityCaps clause breached; `Remedy::Indemnification { amount_bps: contract.params.liability_cap_bps }` if LiabilityCaps involved.
3. Generate `BreachAssessment` with: contract ID, severity, breached clause list, liability assessment in basis points, recommended remedy, timestamp.

### Settlement Integration

`BreachAssessment` feeds into the escalation crate (future integration). The `recommended_remedy` maps to bailment lifecycle transitions:
- `Notice` → no state change, informational
- `Cure` → bailment remains Active, cure period tracked
- `Suspension` → `bailment.status = Suspended`
- `Termination` → `bailment::terminate()`
- `Indemnification` → Termination + financial settlement record

## 6. Contract Versioning & Amendments

### Amendment Model

Amendments never modify the original `ComposedContract`. Instead, `amend()` creates a **new** `ComposedContract` with:
- `version` incremented (original is 1, first amendment is 2, etc.)
- `parent_contract_id = Some(original.id.clone())` — chain link
- New params and/or replaced clauses applied
- New `contract_hash` computed — the original's hash is untouched

### Diff Tracking

The amendment carries `parent_contract_id`, enabling reconstruction of the full amendment chain. Callers can diff rendered clauses between versions by comparing `rendered_clauses` vectors.

### Hash Chain Integrity

Each contract's `contract_hash` is self-contained — it hashes its own rendered content, not the parent. The `parent_contract_id` is a reference, not included in the hash (to keep hashes stable across chain lookups). Verification: `verify_hash(contract)` recomputes the hash from the contract's own `rendered_clauses` and `params`, independent of any parent.

## 7. Human-Readable Output

### Markdown Rendering

`render_markdown(contract)` produces a complete Markdown document:

```markdown
# Bailment Contract: {template_name}

**Contract ID**: {id}
**Version**: {version}
**Composed**: {composed_at}
**Effective**: {effective_date}
**Expires**: {expiry_date or "No expiration"}
**Jurisdiction**: {jurisdiction}
**Data Classification**: {data_classification}

## Parties

- **Bailor**: {bailor_name} ({bailor_did})
- **Bailee**: {bailee_name} ({bailee_did})

## {section_number}. {clause_title}

{rendered_body}

...

---
Contract Hash: {contract_hash}
```

### Section Numbering

Clauses are numbered sequentially starting from 1. Categories provide logical grouping in the template; the rendered document uses flat numbering for simplicity and legal clarity.

### Party Names

DID strings resolved to human-readable names via `ContractParams.bailor_name` / `bailee_name`. Both the name and DID appear in the Parties section for binding legal identity.

### PDF Generation Strategy

Same pipeline as the Board Book: render Markdown → HTML via template → PDF via server-side Puppeteer. Not implemented in this crate (exo-consent is a pure logic crate with no I/O dependencies), but the Markdown output is designed for direct conversion.

## 8. Integration Points

### bailment.rs (Extend, Don't Replace)

The contract engine is additive. Existing `bailment::propose()` still works with raw bytes. New workflow: `compose()` a contract, get `contract_hash`, pass `contract_hash.as_bytes()` as terms to `propose()`, or directly construct a `Bailment` with `terms_hash = contract.contract_hash`. No changes to `bailment.rs`, `policy.rs`, or `gatekeeper.rs`.

### Gatekeeper Integration

`ConsentGate` currently checks bailment status. Extension point: gatekeeper can also verify that a `ComposedContract` exists for the bailment's `terms_hash` and that `verify_hash()` passes. This adds structured contract validation to the consent check without modifying the gatekeeper's deny-by-default posture.

### Evidence Bundles

`ComposedContract` and its rendered Markdown output can be included in evidence bundles for disputes. The `contract_hash` provides content-addressed proof that the contract terms were agreed upon. `BreachAssessment` records reference specific clause IDs, enabling precise evidentiary linking.

### BCTS Lifecycle

The BCTS state machine (14-state lifecycle in `exo-core::bcts`) can reference `contract_hash` in transaction metadata. Receipt chaining includes the contract hash as part of the consent reference, tying every transaction to its governing contract.

## 9. Implementation Plan

### Build Sequence (Test-First)

1. **Error variants**: Add `ContractError` variant to `ConsentError` if needed, or use existing variants. (Decision: use existing `ConsentError` variants — `InvalidState`, `Unauthorized`, `Denied` cover all contract error cases, plus add a generic contract error.)

2. **Data types first**: Define all structs and enums in `contract.rs`. Derive `Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Serialize, Deserialize` where appropriate. No floating point anywhere — all monetary/percentage values are `u64` basis points.

3. **Write all 16 tests**: Tests define the contract (TDD). Each test compiles against the type signatures before implementations exist.

4. **`default_template()`**: Four match arms, one per `BailmentType`. Each returns 8 clauses (one per `ClauseCategory`). Templates are deterministic — no randomness.

5. **`compose()`**: Filter clauses by jurisdiction → substitute params → assign section numbers → serialize to CBOR → hash → build `ComposedContract`. Uses `hash_structured()` from `exo_core::hash`.

6. **`render_markdown()`**: String building with proper Markdown formatting. Pure function, no I/O.

7. **`assess_breach()`**: Validate clause IDs → classify severity → compute liability → recommend remedy.

8. **`amend()`**: Clone original → apply new params and clause replacements → increment version → set parent_contract_id → recompose → rehash.

9. **`verify_hash()`**: Recompute hash from contract contents → compare with stored `contract_hash`.

10. **Run tests, clippy, commit, push.**
