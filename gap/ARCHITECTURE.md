# Architecture of the GAP Layer

The `gap/` directory operates as a governed front-end layer situated directly inside the `exochain` repository (`exochain/exochain/gap`). It is the orchestration point where CEO intent, agentic execution, and cryptographic governance converge. This architecture ensures that all operational and advisory actions are strictly governed, traceable, and continuously improving.

## Integration with ExoChain Crates

The GAP layer does not reinvent core infrastructure; it orchestrates the existing robust ExoChain crates to enforce governance during the advisory engagement.

1. **`exo-governance`**: Serves as the foundational rule engine. All constitutional invariants and Syntaxis protocols defined within `gap/` are parsed and enforced by this crate. It ensures that no agentic action violates the defined bounds of the engagement.
2. **`exo-gatekeeper`**: Acts as the enforcement boundary. When the CEO interacts with the system or when a workflow reaches an approval phase, `exo-gatekeeper` handles identity resolution, cryptographic signatures, and access control.
3. **`exo-dag`**: The immutable ledger of the engagement. Every state change, council resolution, and approved artifact is anchored to the ExoChain DAG via the AI-IRB mechanism. This provides the cryptographically secure Evidence Schema.
4. **`decision-forum`**: The deliberative engine. The GAP layer relies heavily on this crate to process T1+ proposals through the 5-panel council, ensuring multi-disciplinary review before execution.

## Syntaxis Protocol Composition

Doctrine and workflows within the GAP layer are entirely encoded as machine-readable Syntaxis YAML protocols (`gap/syntaxis/`). These protocols compose governance pipelines by defining discrete nodes of execution, evaluation, and transition. 

- **Pipelines**: A protocol strings together intake, assessment, review, and reporting nodes. 
- **Transitions**: State changes within a protocol strictly follow the BCTS (Belief-Choice-Truth-State) state machine. A protocol cannot move an artifact from `Draft` to `Approved` without passing through `Governed` and `Verified` states.
- **Council Hooks**: Protocols natively integrate with the Decision Forum, automatically pausing execution to route through the 5-panel review when thresholds are met.

## Team Architecture and the Organization

The organizational structure within the incubator is divided into two distinct but collaborating team typologies:

### 1. Facilitation/Onboarding Teams
These are the turnkey, client-facing teams. They map to the operational edge of the engagement.
- **Trigger**: Activated immediately upon CEO check-in.
- **Function**: They execute the Syntaxis protocols for ACRC assessments and GAP delivery. They interact with the CEO, build the 6 core deliverables, and present findings to the council.

### 2. Self-Development Teams
These are the introspective, infrastructure teams. They map to the core engineering and quality assurance functions.
- **Trigger**: Activated by performance metrics, system anomalies, or scheduled Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) cycles.
- **Function**: They monitor the platform's health and the effectiveness of the Facilitation Teams. When they identify a degradation or optimization opportunity, they formulate a proposal and interface with **ExoForge** to compile and deploy system improvements autonomously, under council oversight.

## CEO Dashboard Connection

The CEO dashboard is the visual materialization of the `gap/` state. It connects to the backend via secure RPC channels authenticated by `exo-gatekeeper`.
- **Read Path**: The dashboard queries `exo-dag` for historical context and reads the current active Syntaxis nodes to display engagement progress.
- **Write Path**: When the CEO issues an approval or directive, the dashboard signs the payload and submits it to the `decision-forum` or directly to a waiting Syntaxis node.

## Data Flows

1. **Intake**: CEO inputs data → Facilitation Agent parses data → Syntaxis `intake` node initializes.
2. **Execution**: Facilitation Agent drafts an artifact (e.g., Workflow Control Map) → Artifact is submitted to BCTS state `Draft`.
3. **Governance**: Syntaxis protocol triggers Council Review → `decision-forum` crate activates 5-panel review → Council approves → State moves to `Governed`.
4. **Anchoring**: `exo-dag` writes the transition to the immutable ledger.
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Governance Monitor agent detects a bottleneck in step 3 → Triggers CQI cycle → ExoForge generates an optimized Syntaxis YAML → Council approves → System self-updates.
