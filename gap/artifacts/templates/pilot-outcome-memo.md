# Template: Pilot Outcome Memo

*Instructions for Artifact Builder and Engagement Lead: This is the final executive summary. It must be honest, analytical, and aligned with the Kingsmenship Criteria.*

## 1. Executive Summary
*Provide a high-level overview of the GAP engagement and the pilot dry-run.*
- **Objective**: Validate the governance architecture for [Client Name].
- **Duration**: [e.g., 6 weeks]
- **Overall Assessment**: [Ready for MeshCore | Requires Architecture Revision]

## 2. What Worked (Successes)
*Highlight areas where the architecture performed as expected.*
- [e.g., The Escalation Graph successfully caught 3 simulated out-of-bounds transactions and routed them to the CFO.]
- [e.g., The Evidence Schema successfully anchored all BCTS transitions to the test DAG without latency degradation.]

## 3. What Surprised Us (Anomalies)
*Honest assessment of unexpected behaviors or friction points.*
- [e.g., The Policy Gate library for Data Privacy was too strict, resulting in a 40% false-positive rate for internal emails. The Self-Development team had to trigger a CQI loop to refine the regex.]

## 4. Recommended Changes
*Specific adjustments to make before live SaaS deployment.*
- [e.g., Adjust timeout on the Primary Human routing from 15 minutes to 1 hour to prevent alert fatigue.]
- [e.g., Upgrade the autonomous agent model to handle more complex context in Holon 2.]

## 5. Next Steps
*The path to MeshCore.*
1. Final Executive Sign-off on this memo.
2. Port configurations to MeshCore production environment.
3. Decommission the `gap/` incubator Facilitation Team.
