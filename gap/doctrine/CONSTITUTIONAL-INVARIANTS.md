# Constitutional Invariants in GAP

The 10 Constitutional Invariants are the non-negotiable bedrock of ExoChain governance. Within the `gap/` incubator, these invariants are aggressively monitored and enforced to ensure the CEO remains firmly in control of the advisory engagement and all resulting deliverables.

---

### 1. Democratic Legitimacy
- **Definition:** Authority must derive from the explicit consent and mandate of the governed or the designated authority (the CEO).
- **GAP Manifestation:** The entire engagement only begins after the CEO cryptographically signs the ACRC intake and explicitly activates the Facilitation Team. 
- **Violation:** An agent initiating a workflow or defining a policy gate without an upstream mandate.
- **Enforcement:** `exo-gatekeeper` verifies the presence of a valid, signed CEO mandate token before any Syntaxis protocol can execute.

### 2. Delegation Governance
- **Definition:** The transfer of authority to autonomous systems must be explicit, bounded, and revocable.
- **GAP Manifestation:** Central to the creation of the *Authority Matrix* deliverable. The CEO defines exactly what agents can and cannot do.
- **Violation:** An agent exceeding its defined scope or attempting to delegate its own authority unilaterally.
- **Enforcement:** The `authority/` constraints are actively checked by the `exo-governance` crate during every BCTS state transition.

### 3. Dual Control
- **Definition:** High-stakes actions require multi-party or multi-factor authorization. No single entity (human or agent) can unilaterally execute a critical change.
- **GAP Manifestation:** Foundational to the Decision Forum. All T1+ proposals require multi-panel sign-off and, ultimately, CEO approval.
- **Violation:** A single agent or panel attempting to finalize a GAP deliverable without peer or executive review.
- **Enforcement:** Syntaxis `council-review` nodes will physically fail to progress without cryptographic signatures from at least 3 of 5 panels plus the client.

### 4. Human Oversight
- **Definition:** A human must remain in the loop or securely on the loop for all substantive autonomous operations.
- **GAP Manifestation:** The core promise of the incubator. The CEO acts as Executive Chair, reviewing all outputs. The *Escalation Graph* explicitly maps these human-in-the-loop triggers.
- **Violation:** An autonomous workflow executing a state-changing operation without alerting or requesting human validation where required.
- **Enforcement:** Mandatory `ceo-report` and `approval-gate` nodes in the Syntaxis YAML.

### 5. Transparency & Accountability
- **Definition:** All agentic decisions, rationale, and state changes must be legible, auditable, and immutable.
- **GAP Manifestation:** Realized through the *Evidence Schema* deliverable and the ExoChain DAG. Every action taken by the Facilitation Team is logged.
- **Violation:** "Black box" processing or an agent failing to provide BCTS rationale for a decision.
- **Enforcement:** The AI-IRB mechanism ensures no state transitions occur without a corresponding, structured DAG entry.

### 6. Conflict Adjudication
- **Definition:** A clear, pre-defined mechanism must exist to resolve disputes between agents, panels, or human operators.
- **GAP Manifestation:** The Decision Forum serves as the primary adjudicator. If the Architecture panel and Security panel disagree on a GAP deliverable, the protocol forces deliberation.
- **Violation:** Deadlock without escalation, or unauthorized out-of-band resolution.
- **Enforcement:** Syntaxis `error_strategy` and BCTS `Escalated` state routing automatically trigger dispute resolution workflows.

### 7. Technological Humility
- **Definition:** Systems must operate within known limits and gracefully degrade or escalate when facing uncertainty.
- **GAP Manifestation:** The ACRC Facilitator agent scoring systems honestly. Agents must admit when a client's context falls outside their operational parameters.
- **Violation:** An agent confidently generating a *Policy Gate Library* for a domain it does not understand (hallucination/overreach).
- **Enforcement:** Confidence thresholds in the `decision-forum` config. If confidence falls below the threshold, the system halts and escalates to the human.

### 8. Existential Safeguard
- **Definition:** The system must possess immutable "kill switches" to halt catastrophic or runaway behaviors.
- **GAP Manifestation:** The CEO dashboard features an overriding global halt command that instantly freezes all `gap/` execution.
- **Violation:** A workflow continuing execution after a halt command is issued, or attempting to disable the halt mechanism.
- **Enforcement:** Hardcoded interrupts at the `exo-governance` level that bypass all Syntaxis logic to freeze operations.

### 9. Doctrinal Compliance
- **Definition:** All operations must align with the established ideological and strategic doctrine (e.g., FM 3-05 corollaries).
- **GAP Manifestation:** The *Pilot Outcome Memo* must evaluate not just efficiency, but how well the pilot adhered to the organization's stated doctrine.
- **Violation:** Creating an *Authority Matrix* that optimizes for speed by violating the principle of Integration.
- **Enforcement:** The `doctrine-triad-check` node in the council review process specifically scans proposals for doctrinal violations.

### 10. Capability Alignment
- **Definition:** The capabilities granted to an autonomous system must be strictly commensurate with the task assigned and the trust verified.
- **GAP Manifestation:** The Self-Development Team only has access to ExoForge capabilities relevant to the specific CQI issue identified.
- **Violation:** An agent requesting broader network access or elevated permissions beyond what is required to draft a specific artifact.
- **Enforcement:** The `node-registry.json` strictly maps Syntaxis nodes to specific, limited underlying crate capabilities.
