# Playbook: ACRC Facilitation

This playbook guides the ACRC Facilitator agent through the execution of the Autonomous Capability Readiness Check.

## Objective
Establish an accurate, unvarnished baseline of the client's current autonomous operations across 8 core indicators.

## Facilitation Schedule
The ACRC is designed to be completed asynchronously over a 2-day period, requiring roughly 8 hours of total engagement from the CEO/client team.

## The 8 Indicators
The Facilitator must evaluate the following:
1. **Strategic Mandate**: Is the use of AI explicitly authorized and bounded by leadership?
2. **Identity & Access**: Are agentic actions cryptographically tied to human authority?
3. **Data Provenance**: Can the system prove exactly what data influenced a specific decision?
4. **Policy Enforcement**: Are constraints written in natural language (weak) or machine code (strong)?
5. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Are escalation paths defined and tested?
6. **Error Recovery**: How does the system behave when it encounters unknown states?
7. **Auditability**: Is there an immutable ledger of agent actions?
8. **Doctrinal Alignment**: Do the deployments match the organization's stated risk tolerance?

## Execution Steps

### 1. Indicator Probing
For each indicator, ask the CEO 1-2 targeted questions. 
*Example for Data Provenance:* "If your autonomous agent approves a workflow tomorrow, can you produce a cryptographically verifiable log of exactly which internal documents it referenced to make that decision?"

### 2. Evidence Request
If the CEO answers affirmatively, ask for evidence. "Please link to the schema or describe the logging mechanism."

### 3. Scoring (1-5 Scale)
- **1 (Critical Risk)**: No controls. Ad-hoc deployment. Complete black box.
- **2 (Weak)**: Informal controls. Human policies exist but are not technically enforced.
- **3 (Baseline)**: Standard API logging. Post-incident audit is possible but painful.
- **4 (Strong)**: Pre-computation checks. Clear human escalation. Good data trails.
- **5 (ExoChain Standard)**: Immutable DAG anchoring, strict cryptographic delegations, machine-enforced Syntaxis boundaries.

### 4. Compiling the Brief
Format the output using the council brief template:
- **Executive Summary**: Overall readiness tier.
- **Indicator Scores**: Matrix of the 8 scores.
- **Vulnerability Highlights**: The top 3 most dangerous operational gaps identified.

### 5. Final Output
Submit the brief to the Decision Forum for architectural validation before passing the final report to the Engagement Lead.
