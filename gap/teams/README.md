# GAP Agentic Teams Architecture

The GAP incubator operates via a dual-team architecture. This structure separates client-facing execution from backend system optimization, ensuring that the CEO experiences a highly polished advisory engagement while the underlying platform continuously self-improves.

## 1. Facilitation / Onboarding Teams (The Front-End)
These teams are ephemeral, turnkey squads instantiated the moment a CEO checks in. 
- **Mission**: Guide the CEO through the ACRC assessment, run the 4-8 week GAP delivery sprints, and produce the 6 core deliverables.
- **CEO Interaction**: High. The Engagement Lead acts as the primary point of contact, speaking directly to the CEO, asking for clarification, and presenting artifacts for approval.
- **Governance Flow**: They draft artifacts and submit them to the Decision Forum. They cannot approve their own work. They operate strictly under the authority delegated by the CEO.

## 2. Self-Development Teams (The Back-End)
These teams are persistent, infrastructural squads that operate across all active engagements.
- **Mission**: Monitor the health of the incubator, execute Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) cycles, and interface with ExoForge to compile and deploy system upgrades.
- **CEO Interaction**: None. The CEO benefits from their work but does not interact with them directly.
- **Governance Flow**: They analyze metrics and generate self-modification proposals. These proposals are routed through the 5-panel Decision Forum. If approved, the changes are dynamically injected into the active Syntaxis protocols.

## Coordination and boundaries
The two team types interact via the DAG and the Syntaxis protocols. If a Facilitation Agent repeatedly fails at a specific task (e.g., struggles to map a complex workflow), the Self-Development team detects this latency via telemetry, drafts a protocol improvement, gets it approved by the Council, and updates the tools the Facilitation Agent uses. This ensures the incubator gets smarter with every engagement.
