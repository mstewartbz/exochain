# Workflow: DAG Anchoring

This workflow defines how governance events, artifact approvals, and state transitions within the `gap/` incubator are immutably written to the ExoChain Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) via the `exo-dag` crate.

## The Principle of Immutability
To satisfy the Transparency & Accountability invariant, no significant state change can exist solely in local memory. It must be anchored. If it is not on the DAG, it did not happen.

## What Gets Anchored
1. **Intake and Identity**: The CEO's initial cryptographic signature and verified mandate.
2. **BCTS Transitions**: Every time an artifact moves from `Draft` -> `Submitted` -> `Deliberated` -> `Governed` -> `Approved` -> `Executed`.
3. **Council Resolutions**: The individual votes of the 5 panels, their written rationale, and the final aggregate decision.
4. **Artifact Hashes**: When a GAP deliverable is finalized, the SHA-256 hash of the markdown file is anchored, not the raw text (to preserve privacy while ensuring tamper evidence).
5. **System Modifications**: Every patch deployed by the Self-Development team.

## Anchoring Procedure (The `ledger_anchor` node)
When a Syntaxis protocol hits a `ledger_anchor` node, the following procedure executes:

1. **Payload Assembly**: The node packages the required data. This includes the timestamp, the initiating agent/user ID, the target object ID (e.g., `authority-matrix-v1`), the new BCTS state, and the cryptographic signatures of all approvers.
2. **AI-IRB Formatting**: The payload is formatted according to the AI-IRB (Internal Review Board) schema required by `exo-dag`.
3. **Submission**: The payload is submitted to the local `exo-dag` instance via RPC.
4. **Verification**: The system waits for `exo-dag` to process the transaction, resolve the graph dependencies, and return a `dag_receipt` (which includes the transaction hash).
5. **State Finalization**: Only upon receiving a valid `dag_receipt` does the Syntaxis protocol officially mark the step as complete and move to the next node. If the DAG write fails, the workflow halts.
