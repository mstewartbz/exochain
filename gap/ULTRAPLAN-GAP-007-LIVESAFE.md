## 1. Current State: What Works, What's Mocked, What's Broken

### What Works

- **`resolve_query_db`** — correctly queries PostgreSQL for all four query variants
  (`Identity`, `ScanHistory`, `ConsentLog`, `PaceStatus`). The DB layer calls are
  sound and produce well-formed JSON from real row data.
- **`resolve_mutation_db`** — correctly persists scan receipts, consent anchors,
  identity registrations, and audit receipts to Postgres, logging on error.
- **All LiveSafe types** (`LiveSafeIdentity`, `ScanReceipt`, `ConsentAnchor`,
  `TrusteeShardStatus`) are fully defined and serialize cleanly.
- **PACE API** (`pace.rs`) — complete and well-tested: `PaceConfig`, `PaceState`,
  `resolve_operator`, `escalate`, `deescalate` — all with unit tests.
- **Shamir API** (`shamir.rs`) — GF(256) implementation with constant-time field
  arithmetic, property tests, and full coverage.

### What Was Mocked (the bug)

- **`resolve_query`** was a thin wrapper that called `resolve_query_mock()` unconditionally.
  No pool was accepted. Every production query silently returned hardcoded test data
  (`odentityComposite: 72.5`, `scan-001`, etc.).
- **`resolve_mutation`** similarly called `resolve_mutation_mock()` unconditionally,
  so no mutation ever touched the database.
- **`resolve_query_db`** had a second silent mock fallback: on DB error *or* empty result
  set, it returned mock data instead of an honest empty/error response. This masked
  DB connectivity issues and data-not-found conditions.
- **Integration tests** (`livesafe_integration.rs`) contained a single placeholder test
  referencing a stale pre-refactor API (`PaceEnrollment`, `split_secret`, etc.) and were
  entirely disabled.

### What Was Broken

1. Production resolver path never hit the database — mock data in live environments.
2. DB errors in `resolve_query_db` were invisible to callers (silent fallback to mock).
3. Integration test suite was dead weight — zero real coverage of the PACE or Shamir APIs.

## 2. Fix Plan: Mock Fallback Removal

### `resolve_query` → Require a Pool

The old sync signature `fn resolve_query(query: &LiveSafeQuery) -> serde_json::Value`
was replaced with:

```rust
pub async fn resolve_query(
    query: &LiveSafeQuery,
    pool: &sqlx::PgPool,
) -> Result<serde_json::Value, sqlx::Error>
```

This forces all call sites to provide a real database pool. There is no fallback.
Any call site that was relying on the mock behavior will fail to compile — which is
the desired outcome; those sites need to be plumbed with a real pool.

### `resolve_mutation` → Require a Pool

Similarly:

```rust
pub async fn resolve_mutation(
    mutation: &LiveSafeMutation,
    pool: &sqlx::PgPool,
) -> serde_json::Value
```

Delegates directly to `resolve_mutation_db`. No mock path.

### `resolve_query_db` → Honest Error Handling

Removed the silent `_ => resolve_query_mock(query)` arms. Replaced with:
- `Ok(None)` → `serde_json::Value::Null` (identity not found — honest)
- `Err(e)` → log via `tracing::error!`, return `Null` or `json!([])` (still opaque
  to callers, but the error is now observable in logs and not silently masked by mock data)
- Empty result sets now return `[]`, not a fake populated list

### Mock Functions Retained — Labeled `FOR TESTING ONLY`

`resolve_query_mock` and `resolve_mutation_mock` are preserved and made `pub` so tests
can use them directly. Both carry the doc comment:

```
/// FOR TESTING ONLY — returns deterministic mock data. Never call in production resolvers.
```

### Existing Unit Tests Updated

The `#[cfg(test)]` block in `livesafe.rs` was updated to call `resolve_query_mock` and
`resolve_mutation_mock` directly (since `resolve_query`/`resolve_mutation` now require
an async pool). All 11 existing unit tests pass unchanged.

---

## 3. Integration Test Rewrite

### Approach

The old tests referenced `PaceEnrollment`, `ContactRelationship`, `split_secret`, and
`reconstruct_secret` — names that no longer exist after the API simplification. The
entire file was rewritten against the current API surface.

No database is needed for these tests — PACE and Shamir are pure-logic crates.

### Test Coverage (12 tests, all passing)

| Test | What it covers |
|------|---------------|
| `test_pace_config_creation` | PaceConfig fields, DID format, `validate()` pass |
| `test_pace_config_invalid_empty_alternates` | `validate()` rejects empty alternates |
| `test_pace_config_invalid_empty_contingency` | `validate()` rejects empty contingency |
| `test_pace_config_invalid_empty_emergency` | `validate()` rejects empty emergency |
| `test_pace_config_duplicate_did_rejected` | `validate()` rejects cross-level DID duplication |
| `test_pace_state_transitions` | Full escalation chain; over-escalation fails; full de-escalation chain; under-de-escalation fails |
| `test_pace_resolve_operator` | `resolve_operator` at each of the 4 PACE states |
| `test_pace_escalate_deescalate` | Escalation changes operator; de-escalation restores it |
| `test_shamir_split_reconstruct` | 3-of-5 split; threshold reconstruct; commitment check |
| `test_shamir_split_reconstruct_any_threshold_subset` | All 2-of-4 combos reconstruct correctly |
| `test_shamir_insufficient_shares` | Reconstruct with 2 of 3-threshold fails with correct error |
| `test_pace_operator_continuity` | Operator stable within state; changes on transition; restored on de-escalation |

### Architectural note on `test_pace_operator_continuity`

This test directly encodes the LiveSafe continuity guarantee: the operator DID must be
stable and predictable within a PACE state, change deterministically on transition, and
be fully reversible via de-escalation. This is the property that LiveSafe's emergency
response system depends on.

## 4. Constitutional Notes

- **No floating point introduced.** The pre-existing `odentity_composite: f64` field in
  `LiveSafeIdentity` was noted but not modified (out of scope for GAP-007; tracked separately).
- **No unsafe code.** All changes are pure safe Rust.
- **`thiserror` used throughout** in `IdentityError` — no changes needed here.
- **Zero clippy warnings** (`-D warnings`) across both crates after all changes.

## 5. Files Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `crates/exo-gateway/src/livesafe.rs` | `resolve_query` and `resolve_mutation` now require `&sqlx::PgPool`; `resolve_query_db` no longer falls back to mock; mock functions labeled `FOR TESTING ONLY`; unit tests updated to call mock functions directly |
| `crates/exo-identity/tests/livesafe_integration.rs` | Fully rewritten — 12 real integration tests against current PACE + Shamir API |
| `gap/ULTRAPLAN-GAP-007-LIVESAFE.md` | This document |

**GAP-007 closed.**
