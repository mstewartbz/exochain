# The Decision Forum in GAP

The Decision Forum is the deliberative engine of the GAP incubator. It is where high-stakes proposals, GAP deliverables, and system upgrades are subjected to rigorous, multi-disciplinary review before they can be executed.

## What It Governs
The Forum does not micro-manage daily agentic tasks. It governs **Tier 1 (T1)** and higher proposals. In the context of the incubator, this includes:
- Finalization of any of the 6 core GAP deliverables.
- Syntaxis protocol modifications proposed by the Self-Development team.
- Major escalations or constitutional queries raised during an engagement.

## How Proposals Enter
Proposals do not enter the Forum informally. They are automatically submitted via Syntaxis protocol hooks (specifically, the `protocol_call` node invoking `council-review.yaml`). When a Facilitation Agent finishes drafting an *Authority Matrix*, the Syntaxis pipeline pauses, wraps the draft in a formal proposal, and drops it into the Forum's queue.

## The CEO Interaction
The CEO does not sit on the panels. Instead, the CEO sits *above* the Forum as the Executive Chair. 
1. The Forum deliberates and reaches a `Governed` resolution.
2. The resolution, along with the rationale from all 5 panels, is presented to the CEO.
3. The CEO reviews the Council's recommendation and provides the final cryptographic signature to move the proposal to `Approved` and `Executed`.

## DAG Anchoring
Every action in the Forum—the initial proposal, the individual panel votes, the written rationales, and the final resolution—is formatted by the AI-IRB mechanism and immutably recorded to the ExoChain DAG. This ensures complete transparency and accountability for all architectural decisions made during the engagement.
