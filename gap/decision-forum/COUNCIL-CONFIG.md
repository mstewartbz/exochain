# Council Configuration

This configuration defines the rules of engagement for the 5-panel Decision Forum within the `gap/` incubator.

## Panel Composition
The Forum consists of five distinct panels, representing the core ExoChain operational disciplines:
1. **Governance (4-16)**: Evaluates democratic legitimacy and delegation bounds.
2. **Legal (4-18)**: Evaluates compliance, liability, and regulatory alignment.
3. **Architecture (4-20)**: Evaluates structural integrity, Syntaxis validity, and DAG integration.
4. **Security (4-17)**: Evaluates cryptographic boundaries, threat vectors, and access controls.
5. **Operations (4-19)**: Evaluates execution feasibility, latency, and real-world impact.

## Quorum and Confidence Rules
- **Quorum**: All 5 panels must register a vote (Approve, Reject, or Abstain) for a resolution to be valid.
- **T1 Confidence Threshold**: Standard GAP deliverables require a 4/5 approval ratio to achieve the `Governed` state.
- **T2 Confidence Threshold**: Self-Development modifications (Syntaxis patches) require a unanimous 5/5 approval ratio.

## Escalation Paths
- **Deadlock**: If a proposal fails to reach the required threshold after 3 revision attempts, it is flagged as `Escalated`.
- **Resolution**: Deadlocked operational proposals are escalated directly to the CEO for executive override. Deadlocked self-development (system) proposals are escalated to the human ExoChain engineering team.

## Special Rules: CEO-as-Client Scenarios
In the incubator, the client (CEO) holds ultimate veto power. 
- If the Council rejects a proposal that the CEO strongly desires, the CEO can exercise an `Executive Override`. 
- However, if the override violates a core Constitutional Invariant (e.g., bypassing cryptographic dual-control), the system will record the override on the DAG but mark the engagement as `Non-Compliant/High-Risk`, significantly altering the terms of the eventual MeshCore SaaS handoff.
