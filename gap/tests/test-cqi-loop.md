# Test Spec: CQI Self-Improvement Loop

## Description
E2E verification of the `cqi-self-improvement.yaml` Syntaxis protocol. Simulates the Self-Development team detecting an issue and patching the system.

## Test Steps
1. **Initialize**: Mock an `event: threshold_alert` trigger representing a high latency bottleneck in the `artifact-builder` agent.
2. **Execute `collect-metrics`**: Inject mock DAG logs showing the latency.
3. **Execute `analyze-degradation`**: Verify the CQI Lead agent generates an `improvement_hypothesis`.
4. **Execute `generate-proposal`**: Verify the generation of a `syntaxis_patch_proposal`.
5. **Execute `internal-council-review`**: Inject 5/5 "Approve" votes (T2 operations require unanimity).
6. **Execute `exoforge-dispatch`**: **Mock this external call.** Return a dummy compiled artifact.
7. **Execute `verify-improvement`**: Inject a mock "Pass" result from the test suite.
8. **Execute `deploy-and-record`**: Verify the ledger anchoring.

## Expected Outputs
- The system must require a unanimous 5/5 council vote for this T2 protocol patch. (Test should fail if an injected 4/5 vote is accepted).
- The `exoforge_compiled_artifact` must be processed without throwing a type error.
- The final state must reach `Closed`.

## Pass Criteria
The full CQI lifecycle executes, enforcing the higher consensus threshold required for system modifications, and correctly records the patch to the DAG.
