# Test Spec: ACRC Pipeline

## Description
E2E verification of the `acrc-assessment.yaml` Syntaxis protocol. Simulates the intake, assessment, and scoring loop.

## Test Steps
1. **Initialize**: Mock an `event: ceo_check_in` trigger. Provide a valid `verified_identity_token`.
2. **Execute `consent-verify`**: Inject a signed `consent_receipt`.
3. **Execute `acrc-facilitation`**: Inject a pre-recorded mock transcript representing the CEO's answers to the 8 indicator questions.
4. **Execute `scoring`**: Allow the node to process the raw assessment data.
5. **Execute `council-brief`**: Monitor the sub-protocol call to `council-review.yaml`. Inject mock approvals from all 5 panels.
6. **Execute `ceo-report`**: Verify final payload generation.

## Expected Outputs
- The scoring node must output 8 integer values between 1 and 5.
- The readiness tier must map correctly based on the aggregated score.
- The protocol must successfully pause, route to the Decision Forum, and resume upon receiving the `council_resolution`.

## Pass Criteria
The pipeline reaches the `Closed` state. The generated `scored_indicators` payload must exactly match the expected schema defined in the node registry.
