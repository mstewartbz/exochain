# Test Spec: 5-Panel Council Review

## Description
E2E verification of the `council-review.yaml` Syntaxis protocol. Simulates a T1+ proposal moving through the Decision Forum.

## Test Steps
1. **Initialize**: Trigger the protocol via a `protocol_call` event. Provide a mock `syntaxis_patch_proposal` payload.
2. **Execute `limitations-precheck`**: Verify the payload passes basic validation.
3. **Execute Panel Deliberation**: Simultaneously invoke the 5 panel nodes (`panel-gov`, `panel-legal`, `panel-arch`, `panel-sec`, `panel-ops`). Inject mock "Approve" votes for Gov, Legal, Arch, and Ops. Inject a mock "Reject" vote for Sec.
4. **Execute `aggregate-votes`**: Verify the consensus engine processes a 4/5 result.
5. **Execute `doctrine-triad-check`**: Verify the payload passes doctrine evaluation.
6. **Execute `constitutional-validation`**: Verify the invariant checker returns a clean receipt.
7. **Execute `resolution-generation`**: Trigger the ledger anchor.

## Expected Outputs
- The BCTS state must transition from `Deliberated` to `Verified` to `Governed`.
- The `aggregate_result` must show an Approved status because the 4/5 threshold (80%) was met despite the single rejection.
- The `dag_receipt` must be generated.

## Pass Criteria
The system correctly handles a split vote, enforces the confidence threshold, verifies the doctrine constraints, and successfully anchors the resolution to the DAG.
