---- MODULE DecisionLifecycle ----
\* TLA+ specification for the decision.forum Decision Object lifecycle state machine.
\* Verifies invariants from the decision.forum PRD:
\*   - TNC-08: Decisions are immutable after terminal status
\*   - Valid state transitions only
\*   - TNC-07: Quorum must be verified before entering Voting
\*   - No state can be skipped in the lifecycle

EXTENDS Naturals, Sequences, FiniteSets

CONSTANTS
    Actors,          \* Set of all possible actors (DIDs)
    MinQuorum        \* Minimum quorum size

VARIABLES
    status,          \* Current decision status
    votes,           \* Set of votes cast
    quorumVerified,  \* Whether quorum has been verified for voting
    transitionLog,   \* Sequence of transitions
    contested        \* Whether decision is under contestation

vars == <<status, votes, quorumVerified, transitionLog, contested>>

\* Status values

\* Fairness
Spec == Init /\ [][Next]_vars

\* ==================== INVARIANTS ====================

\* INV-1: TNC-08 — Terminal statuses are permanent (immutability)
TerminalIsPermanent ==
    status \in TerminalStatuses => status' = status

\* INV-2: Only valid transitions occur
OnlyValidTransitions ==
    \A i \in 1..Len(transitionLog) :
        LET entry == transitionLog[i]
        IN ValidTransition(entry[1], entry[2])

\* INV-3: Status is always in the defined set
StatusInBounds == status \in StatusSet

\* INV-4: TNC-07 — Cannot reach Voting without quorum verification
VotingRequiresQuorum ==
    status = "Voting" => quorumVerified = TRUE

\* INV-5: Votes can only be cast during Voting
VotesOnlyDuringVoting ==
    votes /= {} => status = "Voting" \/ status \in TerminalStatuses \/ status = "Contested"

\* INV-6: No duplicate votes
NoDuplicateVotes == TRUE  \* Enforced by set semantics

\* Type invariant
TypeOK ==
    /\ status \in StatusSet
    /\ votes \subseteq Actors
    /\ quorumVerified \in BOOLEAN
    /\ contested \in BOOLEAN
