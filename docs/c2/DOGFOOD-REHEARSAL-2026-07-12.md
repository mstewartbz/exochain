# Mission C2 Dogfood Rehearsal — 2026-07-12

**Status:** Partial (machine rehearsal complete; human dual-gate on a live GAP item still required)  
**Operators:** Bob (`bob-stewart`), Max (`mstewartbz`)  
**Branch / PR:** `cursor/cloud-agent-1783858638696-q6upw` / #791

## Slice executed

1. Doctrine + nodes present under `docs/c2/` (dagdb-memory, proof-verification, platform-release included).
2. Machine AI-IRB rehearsal via `cargo test -p exochain-consensus --test presidential_c2_bridge --features providers`:
   - Strategic panel with xAI/OpenAI/Anthropic/Google seats
   - Devil’s advocate review present
   - Advisory receipts bound; dissent receipt required
   - AI-IRB approve alone **fails** two-person gate
   - Bob + Max verified human Approves **pass** two-person gate
3. CCIR noise check (paper): routine ExoForge heuristic panels and doc-only PRs classified **non-CCIR** (no push).

## Outcomes / CCIR calibration notes

| Signal | Push? | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Constitutional dual-gate incomplete | Yes (CCIR) | Keep |
| AI-IRB dissent present with empty evidence | No (fail closed off brief) | Keep |
| Routine task completion | No | Keep |
| Railway health fail after promote | Yes (CCIR) | Keep |

## Blockers to full dogfood close

- Human Bob+Max attestation on one **live** Strategic/Constitutional GAP/ratification item (not only the automated bridge fixture).
- GitHub Actions secrets not writable by this cloud-agent token (`HTTP 403` on `gh secret set/list`).
- Railway variables require Bob’s Railway OAuth/session (device login) — see [SECRETS-ACTIVATION.md](SECRETS-ACTIVATION.md).

## Push enablement decision

**Do not enable live Slack/SMS push yet.** Remain fail-closed until:

1. PR #791 merged to `main`
2. Secrets configured per [SECRETS-ACTIVATION.md](SECRETS-ACTIVATION.md)
3. Bob+Max complete one live dual-gate ratify/veto on a real item and update this record to **Complete**

## Required secrets (names only — values must be set by operators)

Operator runbook: [SECRETS-ACTIVATION.md](SECRETS-ACTIVATION.md).

### GitHub Actions (`exochain/exochain`)

- `PRESIDENTIAL_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`
- `PRESIDENTIAL_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` (and related Twilio SID/from/to as used by CommandBase)

### Railway (EXOCHAIN / CommandBase services)

- `EXOCHAIN_API_BASE_URL`
- `PRESIDENTIAL_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`
- `PRESIDENTIAL_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` (+ Twilio companions)
- Optional: LLM provider keys only after live adapter activation (not required for dogfood close)

## Commands re-run

```bash
bash tools/test_mission_c2_graph.sh
cargo test -p exochain-consensus --test presidential_c2_bridge --features providers
cargo test -p exochain-decision-forum two_person
node --test command-base/app/lib/presidential-desk.test.js
