# Catapult Integration Report: As-Is vs Planned

**Date:** 2026-04-08
**Crate:** exo-catapult v0.1.0-alpha
**Branch:** feat/exo-catapult

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The `exo-catapult` Rust crate is complete as a standalone library — 2,820 lines across 11 modules with 80 passing tests and zero clippy warnings. It models the FM 3-05 franchise incubator with full lifecycle state machine, ODA team management, and Paperclip-derived heartbeat/budget/goal systems.

Two integration layers remain:
1. **WASM Bridge** — Exposing catapult functions to JavaScript via `exochain-wasm`
2. **CommandBase Integration** — Wiring catapult agents into the 105-agent governance hypervisor

This report details what exists today, what the target integration looks like, and the precise gap between them.

## 2. As-Is: exo-catapult Crate

### 2.1 Module Inventory

| Module | Lines | Types | Tests | Purpose |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| `oda.rs` | 211 | MosCode (8), OdaSlot (12) | 7 | FM 3-05 team structure, MOS codes, authority hierarchy |
| `phase.rs` | 176 | OperationalPhase (6) | 7 | 6-phase lifecycle state machine with transition validation |
| `agent.rs` | 285 | CatapultAgent, AgentRoster, AgentStatus (5) | 10 | Agent entities, slot management, DID generation |
| `franchise.rs` | 183 | FranchiseBlueprint, FranchiseRegistry, BusinessModel (6) | 6 | Immutable franchise templates |
| `newco.rs` | 388 | Newco, NewcoStatus (5), NewcoRegistry | 9 | Company entities with governed lifecycle |
| `heartbeat.rs` | 272 | HeartbeatMonitor, HeartbeatRecord, HeartbeatStatus (5), HeartbeatAlert, AlertSeverity (2) | 6 | Agent liveness with warning/critical thresholds |
| `budget.rs` | 328 | BudgetLedger, BudgetPolicy, CostEvent, BudgetVerdict (3), BudgetScope (3), BudgetMetric (3), BudgetWindow (3), BudgetTemplate | 7 | Integer-only budget enforcement |
| `goal.rs` | 354 | GoalTree, Goal, GoalLevel (4), GoalStatus (5), GoalTemplate, GoalSeed | 11 | Hierarchical alignment scoring in basis points |
| `receipt.rs` | 273 | FranchiseReceipt, FranchiseOperation (12), ReceiptChain | 4 | Hash-chained trust receipts with integrity verification |
| `integration.rs` | 225 | PaceConfig, DecisionClass (4), HealthSummary | 5 | PACE builder, decision classification, health summaries |
| `error.rs` | 83 | CatapultError (12) | 1 | Typed error variants |
| `lib.rs` | 42 | — | — | Module declarations, re-exports |
| **Total** | **2,820** | **~45 types** | **80** | |

### 2.2 What Works Today

- Full ODA 12-slot team with FM 3-05 MOS mapping
- Phase state machine with forward/backward transitions and roster gating
- Agent hiring pipeline: founders (HR + Deep Researcher) → leadership → full ODA
- Hash-chained receipt generation with integrity verification
- Heartbeat monitoring with configurable warning/critical thresholds
- Budget enforcement using integer cents and basis point thresholds
- Goal tree with hierarchical alignment scoring (0–10000 bps)
- PACE configuration derived from ODA command hierarchy
- Decision classification (Routine/Operational/Strategic/Constitutional)
- Health summary aggregation
- Full serde roundtrip for all types

### 2.3 What Does NOT Work Today

- **No WASM exports** — The crate compiles as `rlib` only; JavaScript cannot call any function
- **No CommandBase integration** — Agent profiles exist as Rust structs but are not written to Team/.md files or the SQLite `team_members` table
- **No GSD endpoints** — No HTTP surface for catapult operations
- **No governance receipt chain** — Receipts are generated in Rust but not written to CommandBase's `governance_receipts` SQLite table
- **No worker integration** — Catapult agents cannot be dispatched for autonomous task execution
- **No WebSocket events** — Newco lifecycle changes are not broadcast to the dashboard

---

## 3. As-Is: WASM Bridge (exochain-wasm)

### 3.1 Current Architecture

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Exported functions | 110 |
| Binding files | 9 domain-specific + 1 serde bridge |
| Pattern | `#[wasm_bindgen] pub fn wasm_*(&str) -> Result<JsValue, JsValue>` |
| Serialization | JSON strings via `serde_bridge::from_json_str` / `to_js_value` |
| Error handling | Domain errors mapped to `JsValue::from_str(format!("Context: {e}"))` |
| Crate type | `cdylib` + `rlib` |
| Dependencies | 13 of 16 domain crates (excludes exo-gateway, exo-node, exo-catapult) |

### 3.2 Binding File Pattern

```
exochain-wasm/src/
├── lib.rs                      # mod declarations + pub use *_bindings::*
├── serde_bridge.rs             # from_json_str<T>(), to_js_value<T>()
├── core_bindings.rs            # 14 functions — crypto, hashing, events, BCTS
├── identity_bindings.rs        # 7 functions — Shamir, PACE, risk
├── authority_bindings.rs       # 4 functions — delegation chains
├── consent_bindings.rs         # 4 functions — bailment lifecycle
├── gatekeeper_bindings.rs      # 5 functions — combinators, invariants, holons
├── governance_bindings.rs      # 13 functions — quorum, clearance, audit
├── escalation_bindings.rs      # 8 functions — triage, feedback, kanban
├── legal_bindings.rs           # 12 functions — evidence, privilege, fiduciary
└── decision_forum_bindings.rs  # 43 functions — decisions, TNCs, challenges
```

### 3.3 Export Convention

Every function follows this exact pattern:

```rust
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn wasm_<domain>_<action>(json_param: &str, ...) -> Result<JsValue, JsValue> {
    let input: DomainType = from_json_str(json_param)?;
    let result = domain_crate::do_thing(&input)
        .map_err(|e| JsValue::from_str(&format!("Context: {e}")))?;
    to_js_value(&result)
}
```

Flat namespace — all 110 functions re-exported at crate root as `exochain_wasm::wasm_*`.

## 4. As-Is: CommandBase

### 4.1 Current Architecture

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Agent profiles | 105 markdown files in Team/ |
| GSD endpoints | 21 (5 agent, 5 decision, 4 constitutional, 5 identity, 2 holon) |
| System API routes | 50+ across 18 route modules |
| WASM functions consumed | 110 via `app/services/exochain.js` (1,294 lines) |
| Database | SQLite with WAL mode |
| Agent execution | Worker polling every 10s, spawns `claude -p` CLI |
| Real-time | WebSocket broadcast for state changes |

### 4.2 Agent Profile Template (Team/*.md)

```markdown
# [Name] — [Title]

## Identity
- **Name:** [Name]
- **Title:** [Job Title]
- **Tier:** [board|c-suite|specialist|orchestrator|leader|co-leader]
- **Reports To:** [Manager Name]
- **Department:** [Department]

## Persona
[Character description]

## Core Competencies
[Skills list]

## Methodology
[Work process]

## Purview & Restrictions
### Owns
[Domains]
### Cannot Touch
[Off-limits areas]

## Quality Bar
[Acceptance criteria]
```

### 4.3 Database Schema for Team (SQLite)

```sql
team_members:
  id, name (UNIQUE), role, status, execution_mode, tier,
  reports_to, did_identity, llm_provider_id, llm_model,
  adapter_type, adapter_config, runtime_config,
  capabilities [], permissions [], metadata {},
  profile_path  -- path to Team/*.md file
```

### 4.4 Governance Receipt Chain

Every GSD action creates a hash-chained receipt in `governance_receipts`:

```sql
governance_receipts:
  id, action_type, entity_type, entity_id, actor, description,
  payload_hash, previous_hash, receipt_hash,
  branch (legislative|judicial|executive),
  adjudication (pass|warn|fail|defer),
  chain_depth, invariants_checked, verified
```

### 4.5 Worker Agent Dispatch

```
Poll SQLite → find eligible task → load member profile →
build prompt with persona + tools → spawn `claude -p` →
capture output → route to orchestrator for review → update status
```

---

## 5. Planned: WASM Bridge Integration

### 5.1 New File

`crates/exochain-wasm/src/catapult_bindings.rs` — ~18 exported functions

### 5.2 Planned Exports

### 5.3 Changes Required

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `exochain-wasm/Cargo.toml` | Add `exo-catapult = { path = "../exo-catapult" }` |
| `exochain-wasm/src/lib.rs` | Add `pub mod catapult_bindings;` + `pub use catapult_bindings::*;` |
| `exochain-wasm/src/catapult_bindings.rs` | New file — ~18 functions, ~400 lines |
| `exochain-wasm/Cargo.toml` [cargo-machete] | Add `"exo-catapult"` to ignored list |

### 5.4 Architectural Pattern

Follows the exact same pattern as the existing 110 functions:

```rust
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;
use crate::serde_bridge::{from_json_str, to_js_value};

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn wasm_instantiate_newco(
    blueprint_json: &str,
    name: &str,
    founder_dids_json: &str,
) -> Result<JsValue, JsValue> {
    let blueprint: FranchiseBlueprint = from_json_str(blueprint_json)?;
    let founder_dids: Vec<String> = from_json_str(founder_dids_json)?;
    // ... create newco, hire founders
    to_js_value(&newco)
}
```

### 5.5 Gap Analysis: WASM Bridge

| Aspect | As-Is | Planned | Gap |
|--------|-------|---------|-----|
| exo-catapult in WASM deps | Not listed | Listed as dependency | 1 line in Cargo.toml |
| catapult_bindings.rs | Does not exist | ~400 lines, 18 functions | New file |
| lib.rs mod declaration | 9 binding modules | 10 binding modules | 2 lines |
| Total WASM exports | 110 | ~128 | +18 functions |
| serde_bridge.rs | Complete — reusable | No changes needed | None |
| WASM binary size | ~2.8 MB (est.) | ~3.0 MB (est.) | +~200 KB |
| Build pipeline | wasm-pack, CI Gate | Same pipeline | No change |

**Effort estimate scope:** Small — follows established patterns exactly. The serde bridge, error handling, and export conventions are all proven. This is mechanical work.

---

## 6. Planned: CommandBase Integration

### 6.1 New Files

| File | Purpose | Est. Lines |
|------|---------|------------|
| `command-base/app/services/catapult.js` | JavaScript wrapper for catapult WASM functions | ~300 |
| `command-base/app/routes/catapult.js` | Express routes for franchise operations | ~400 |
| `command-base/Team/catapult-*.md` (×12 per newco) | ODA agent profiles generated from templates | ~100 each |

### 6.2 New Service Layer: catapult.js

Mirrors the existing `exochain.js` pattern — thin JavaScript wrappers around WASM calls:

```javascript
const wasm = require('@exochain/exochain-wasm');

function s(v) { return JSON.stringify(v); }

// Franchise
function createFranchiseBlueprint(name, model, constitutionHash) {
  return wasm.wasm_create_franchise_blueprint(name, s(model), constitutionHash);
}

// Newco
function instantiateNewco(blueprint, name, founderDids) {
  return wasm.wasm_instantiate_newco(s(blueprint), name, s(founderDids));
}

// ... 16 more wrappers
module.exports = { createFranchiseBlueprint, instantiateNewco, ... };
```

### 6.3 New Route Module: catapult.js

**Planned endpoints (mapped to GSD pattern):**

| Method | Path | Action | Receipt Type |
|--------|------|--------|--------------|
| `POST` | `/api/catapult/franchise` | Create franchise blueprint | `franchise_create` |
| `GET` | `/api/catapult/franchise` | List blueprints | — |
| `POST` | `/api/catapult/newco` | Instantiate newco from blueprint | `newco_create` |
| `GET` | `/api/catapult/newco/:id` | Get newco status + health summary | — |
| `POST` | `/api/catapult/newco/:id/phase` | Advance operational phase | `phase_transition` |
| `POST` | `/api/catapult/newco/:id/hire` | Hire agent into ODA slot | `agent_hire` |
| `POST` | `/api/catapult/newco/:id/release` | Release agent from slot | `agent_release` |
| `GET` | `/api/catapult/newco/:id/roster` | Get ODA roster status | — |
| `POST` | `/api/catapult/newco/:id/heartbeat` | Record agent heartbeat | `heartbeat_record` |
| `GET` | `/api/catapult/newco/:id/health` | Check heartbeat health | — |
| `POST` | `/api/catapult/newco/:id/cost` | Record cost event | `cost_record` |
| `GET` | `/api/catapult/newco/:id/budget` | Get budget status | — |
| `POST` | `/api/catapult/newco/:id/goal` | Create goal | `goal_create` |
| `PATCH` | `/api/catapult/newco/:id/goal/:gid` | Update goal status | `goal_update` |
| `GET` | `/api/catapult/newco/:id/alignment` | Get alignment score | — |

Each mutating endpoint creates a governance receipt and broadcasts a WebSocket event.

### 6.4 Agent Profile Generation

When a newco is instantiated, Catapult generates 12 Team/*.md profiles:

```
Team/catapult-<short_id>-venturecommander.md
Team/catapult-<short_id>-operationsdeputy.md
Team/catapult-<short_id>-processarchitect.md
Team/catapult-<short_id>-deepresearcher.md
Team/catapult-<short_id>-growthengineer1.md
Team/catapult-<short_id>-growthengineer2.md
Team/catapult-<short_id>-communications1.md
Team/catapult-<short_id>-communications2.md
Team/catapult-<short_id>-hrpeopleops1.md
Team/catapult-<short_id>-hrpeopleops2.md
Team/catapult-<short_id>-platformengineer1.md
Team/catapult-<short_id>-platformengineer2.md
```

Each profile follows the established Team/ template but with:
- **Tier** mapped from ODA authority depth (0→board, 1→c-suite, 2→leader, 3→specialist)
- **Reports To** following the ODA chain (specialists → ProcessArchitect → OperationsDeputy → VentureCommander)
- **Department** set to `Catapult — <newco name>`
- **Persona** generated from franchise blueprint business model + slot role
- **Purview** scoped to the MOS specialty domain

### 6.5 Database Schema Additions

```sql
-- New table: franchise blueprints
catapult_blueprints:
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  business_model TEXT NOT NULL,
  constitution_hash TEXT,
  blueprint_json TEXT NOT NULL,  -- full serialized FranchiseBlueprint
  created_at TEXT DEFAULT (datetime('now'))

-- New table: active newcos
catapult_newcos:
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  franchise_id TEXT REFERENCES catapult_blueprints(id),
  phase TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Assessment',
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Provisioning',
  newco_json TEXT NOT NULL,  -- full serialized Newco state
  created_at TEXT DEFAULT (datetime('now')),
  updated_at TEXT DEFAULT (datetime('now'))

-- New table: ODA slot → team_member mapping
catapult_roster:
  newco_id TEXT REFERENCES catapult_newcos(id),
  slot TEXT NOT NULL,
  member_id INTEGER REFERENCES team_members(id),
  did_identity TEXT,
  hired_at TEXT,
  PRIMARY KEY (newco_id, slot)
```

### 6.6 Worker Integration

Catapult agents become eligible for autonomous execution through the existing worker pipeline:

1. **Profile loaded** from `catapult_roster` → `team_members` join
2. **Prompt built** with ODA role persona + franchise business context
3. **Dispatched** via `claude -p` with model selection per existing rules
4. **Receipt generated** for every autonomous action

The two founding agents (HR + Deep Researcher) are the first to execute autonomously during the Selection phase — HR evaluates candidates, Deep Researcher produces market intelligence.

### 6.7 Gap Analysis: CommandBase

| Aspect | As-Is | Planned | Gap |
|--------|-------|---------|-----|
| WASM service wrappers | `exochain.js` (110 functions, 1,294 lines) | + `catapult.js` (~18 functions, ~300 lines) | New file |
| Route modules | 18 modules, 21 GSD endpoints | + `catapult.js` (15 endpoints) | New file |
| Team profiles | 105 static .md files | + 12 per newco (generated) | Profile generator function |
| SQLite tables | team_members, tasks, governance_receipts, ... | + catapult_blueprints, catapult_newcos, catapult_roster | 3 new tables |
| server.js route mounting | 18 route mounts | + 1 catapult route mount | ~5 lines |
| bootstrap-schema.js | Existing tables | + 3 new CREATE TABLE statements | ~30 lines |
| Worker eligibility | Checks team_members.execution_mode | Same — catapult agents are team_members | No change to worker logic |
| WebSocket events | Broadcasts on GSD actions | + broadcasts on catapult actions | Follow existing pattern |
| Governance receipts | Hash-chained for all GSD actions | + hash-chained for all catapult actions | Follow existing pattern |

---

## 7. Integration Sequence

### Phase A: WASM Bridge (can proceed immediately)

```
1. Add exo-catapult dep to exochain-wasm/Cargo.toml
2. Create catapult_bindings.rs with 18 functions
3. Add mod + pub use to lib.rs
4. Build: wasm-pack build crates/exochain-wasm --target nodejs
5. Verify: wasm-pack test --node crates/exochain-wasm
```

**Depends on:** Nothing — exo-catapult crate is complete.

### Phase B: CommandBase Service + Routes (depends on Phase A)

```
1. Create app/services/catapult.js (WASM wrappers)
2. Create 3 SQLite tables in bootstrap-schema.js
3. Create app/routes/catapult.js (15 endpoints)
4. Mount routes in server.js
5. Add WebSocket event broadcasts
```

**Depends on:** WASM binary rebuilt with catapult exports.

### Phase C: Agent Profile Generation (depends on Phase B)

```
1. Build profile template generator (ODA slot → Team/*.md)
2. On newco creation: generate 12 profiles + insert team_members rows
3. Link catapult_roster to team_members via DID
4. On agent hire: update member status to 'active'
```

**Depends on:** Routes operational for newco creation.

### Phase D: Worker Dispatch (depends on Phase C)

```
1. No worker code changes needed — catapult agents are standard team_members
2. Set execution_mode='autonomous' for founding agents
3. Founding agents (HR + Deep Researcher) execute first
4. They hire remaining ODA through governed task pipeline
```

**Depends on:** Agent profiles exist in team_members table.

## 8. Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| WASM binary size increase | Low — catapult types are data-heavy, logic-light | Monitor with `wasm-pack build --release`, wasm-opt if needed |
| State management complexity | Medium — Newco state serialized as JSON blobs in SQLite | Follow existing pattern (governance_receipts stores full payload) |
| Profile generation at scale | Low — 12 files per newco, deterministic naming | Template-based generation, idempotent writes |
| Concurrent newco operations | Medium — SQLite WAL handles concurrent reads but single writer | Batch writes within transactions, same as existing GSD pattern |
| Founding agent bootstrap | Medium — HR and Deep Researcher must self-organize | Seed initial tasks with franchise blueprint goals |

---
