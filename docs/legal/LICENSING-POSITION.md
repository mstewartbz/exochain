# EXOCHAIN Licensing Position

**Effective**: 2026-03-20
**License**: Apache License 2.0 (`Apache-2.0`)

---

## 1. Authoritative License

EXOCHAIN is licensed under the **Apache License, Version 2.0**. The full license text is in [`LICENSE`](../../LICENSE) at the repository root.

All Rust crates in the workspace inherit this license via `license.workspace = true` in their `Cargo.toml` manifests.

## 2. Scope

The Apache-2.0 license applies to:
- All Rust source code in `crates/`
- All tooling in `tools/`
- All documentation in `docs/` and `governance/`
- The demo platform in `demo/`
- CI/CD configurations in `.github/`
- The WASM compilation target (`exochain-wasm`)

## 3. Rationale

Apache-2.0 was chosen because:
- It permits use in both open-source and proprietary downstream projects
- It includes an explicit patent grant, important for a cryptographic substrate
- It is compatible with the vast majority of Rust ecosystem dependencies
- It allows constitutional governance experimentation without imposing copyleft obligations on downstream adopters
- It is widely understood in enterprise and government procurement contexts

## 4. Dependency License Screening

All dependencies are screened via `cargo-deny` (see `deny.toml`):

**Allowed dependency licenses**:
- MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause, ISC, Zlib, CC0-1.0, BSL-1.0, Unicode-3.0, Unicode-DFS-2016, OpenSSL

**Denied dependency licenses**:
- GPL-2.0, GPL-3.0, LGPL-2.0/2.1/3.0, MPL-2.0, EUPL-1.1/1.2, CPAL-1.0, SSPL-1.0
- Any unlicensed crate

**Banned crates**:
- `openssl` / `openssl-sys` — EXOCHAIN uses pure-Rust cryptography (ed25519-dalek, blake3)

## 5. Downstream Users

If you use EXOCHAIN in your project:
- You may use, modify, and distribute under the terms of Apache-2.0
- You must include the license notice and any NOTICE file
- You must state changes if you modify the source
- The patent grant in Apache-2.0 covers contributions made by ExoChain contributors
- No copyleft obligation is imposed on your downstream code

## 6. Consistency Enforcement

The following sources must all declare `Apache-2.0`:
- `LICENSE` file (full text)
- `Cargo.toml` workspace `license` field
- All crate `Cargo.toml` files (via `license.workspace = true`)
- `deny.toml` comments
- `README.md` license section
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` license references

Any divergence is a bug. The `tools/repo_truth.sh` utility checks for consistency.

## 7. Historical Note

Prior to 2026-03-20, the `Cargo.toml` incorrectly declared `AGPL-3.0-or-later` while the LICENSE file contained Apache-2.0 text and all public documentation referenced Apache-2.0. This was an error introduced during initial scaffolding. The authoritative intent was always Apache-2.0, as evidenced by the LICENSE file, README, and CONTRIBUTING.md. This has been corrected.
