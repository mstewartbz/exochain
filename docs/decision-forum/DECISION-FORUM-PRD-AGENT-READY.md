# decision.forum — PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD)
# Version: 1.1.0 — COMPLETE EXECUTABLE SINGLE-FILE EDITION
# Status: Agent-Ready / OpenClaw / OpenForge Ingestion
# Date: 2026-03-14

## 1. Core Axioms (Hard invariants — must be enforced in code)

1. Authority is held in trust, never owned.
2. Decisions are first-class sovereign objects (storable, diffable, transferable, auditable, contestable).
3. Trust accumulation > speed — verification gates are features, not bottlenecks.
4. Constitutional constraints must be machine-readable and enforced at runtime — never advisory.
5. Authority without cryptographically verifiable provenance is void.

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements (must be satisfied by architecture)

- Scale targets: 10 000 tenants, 1 M decisions/day, 50-year immutable history
- P99 chain-of-authority + constraint verification latency: < 200 ms
- Availability: 99.999 % (multi-region active-active, RPO < 1 min, RTO < 15 min)
- Cryptography: Ed25519 today → hybrid post-quantum (Kyber/ML-DSA or equivalent) migration path
- Storage tiers: hot LRU cache + S3-compatible cold / Glacier Deep Archive
- Formal verification: TLA+ model checking of all core invariants + runtime assertion monitoring
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.2 Level AA + neurodiversity accommodations
- Security: SOC 2 Type II + ISO 27001 + zero-trust multi-tenant enclaves

## 3. Governance Requirements

GOV-001  Machine-Readable Constitutional Framework                                 [P0]
        The system SHALL maintain — per tenant — a signed, versioned, machine-readable constitutional corpus containing charter, bylaws, board policies, committee charters, delegation matrices, and jurisdiction-specific rules.
        • Schema: JSON / YAML with semantic versioning
        • Real-time constraint evaluation: < 2 s
        • Every Decision Object stores cryptographic hash(es) of constitution version(s) in force at creation and approval
        • Dry-run mode for proposed amendments
        Failure case: Bylaw supermajority requirement exists only in PDF → $15 M contract passes on simple majority → minority suit

GOV-002  Constitutional Versioning with Temporal Binding                           [P0]
        Every Decision Object MUST be immutably bound to the constitutional version(s) in force at the time of its lifecycle events. Retroactive amendments prohibited by default.
        • Semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)
        • Amendments are themselves Decision Objects
        • Queryable: “Under which version was Decision X compliant?” with proof
        • Retroactive application requires explicit constitutional RETROACTIVE_APPLICATION authority

GOV-003  Delegated Authority Matrix with Scope, Time, Revocation                  [P0]
        Real-time matrix of every actor (human/AI) → explicit, signed, scoped, time-bound, revocable authorities.
        • Signed JSON records
        • Auto-expiry enforcement
        • Full chain retrievable < 3 s
        • Sub-delegation only if explicitly permitted and scope-capped
        • Revocation immediate & irretroversible

GOV-004  Standing Authority Sunset and Renewal                                    [P1]
        All standing authorities expire (default max 12 months) and require affirmative renewal via new Decision Object.
        • 90/60/30/14/7-day notifications
        • Expired → blocked
        • Sunset calendar across organization

GOV-005  Authority Chain Verification on Every State Change                      [P0]
        Every governed action MUST synchronously verify the full cryptographic chain of authority from constitutional source to acting agent.
        • Verification < 2 s (≤ 5 levels)
        • Broken chain → CHAIN_BREAK rejection + diagnostic
        • Cannot be bypassed or deferred
        • Offline portable verification tool

GOV-006  Constitutional Conflict Resolution Hierarchy                             [P1]
        Deterministic precedence (e.g. Articles > Bylaws > Resolutions > Charters > Policies) with human escalation on conflict.
        • Auto-block + route to designated authority
        • Conflict Register + resolution trail

GOV-007  Human Oversight Gates for AI-Assisted Decisions                          [P0]
        AI agents are delegated-only; cannot satisfy HUMAN_GATE_REQUIRED classes; human vs AI signatures cryptographically distinguishable.
        • HUMAN_GATE_REQUIRED list only modifiable via constitutional amendment
        • AI max delegation duration 90 days default
        • AI cannot create/modify delegations

GOV-008  Structured Contestation and Reversal Protocol                            [P0]
        Every Decision Object supports formal contestation by authorised stakeholders.
        • Creates linked Challenge Object
        • CONTESTED status pauses execution (except emergencies)
        • Resolution is new Decision Object
        • Reversal creates immutable REVERSAL linkage

GOV-009  Emergency Action Protocol with Retrospective Ratification                [P0]
        Expedited actions under strict EMERGENCY_AUTHORITY delegation; mandatory ratification.
        • Limited enumerated actions + monetary caps
        • Auto-creates RATIFICATION_REQUIRED follow-up
        • Unratified after timeframe → RATIFICATION_EXPIRED
        • Frequency > 3/quarter → automatic governance review

GOV-010  Quorum Failure and Graceful Governance Degradation                       [P1]
        Defined degradation protocols when quorum cannot be achieved.
        • Auto-detect → DEGRADED_GOVERNANCE
        • Restricted actions + mandatory later ratification

GOV-011  Succession and Continuity Protocols                                      [P1]
        Pre-defined, automatically activated succession for all key roles.
        • ≥ 2 successors per role
        • Triggers: declaration / unresponsiveness / designated activator

GOV-012  Accountability Mechanisms — Censure, Suspension, Revocation, Recall     [P1]
        Formal actions as Decision Objects with due process enforcement.
        • Suspension immediate (< 60 s system-wide)
        • Due process timelines clocked by system

GOV-013  Recursive Self-Governance & Safe Meta-Modification Protocol              [P0]
        All platform evolution (sprints, features, model upgrades, constitutional changes) MUST be governed as first-class Decision Objects under the same rules the platform enforces on tenants.
        • OpenForge sprints = Decision Objects
        • Governance Simulator stress-tests proposed changes
        • 100 % self-modification compliance metric required

## 8. Trust-Critical Non-Negotiable Controls (TNC)

These 10 controls are absolute — shipping without any of them is a governance defect.

TNC-01  Authority Chain Verification Gate
        Every governed action MUST pass real-time authority chain verification before execution. No “skip verification” mode, no administrative override, no grace period. Action without verified authority chain does not execute. Period.

TNC-02  Human Gate Integrity for Designated Decision Classes
        Decision classes marked HUMAN_GATE_REQUIRED MUST require cryptographically verified human approval. System MUST distinguish human from AI signatures at cryptographic level. No configuration, API, or administrative action can reclassify HUMAN_GATE_REQUIRED decision classes to remove the human gate — requires constitutional amendment.

TNC-03  Tamper-Evident Audit Log Continuity
        Audit log hash chain MUST be continuous and unbroken. Any gap, discontinuity, or integrity failure in the audit log is a P0 incident requiring immediate investigation and disclosure to the board. System MUST self-verify log integrity continuously (minimum: hourly).

TNC-04  Constitutional Constraint Enforcement Synchronicity
        Constitutional constraints MUST be evaluated synchronously — before action completes, not after. Post-hoc constraint checking is a monitoring supplement, never a substitute for pre-action enforcement.

TNC-05  Delegation Expiry Enforcement
        Expired delegations are dead. System enforces expiry automatically, immediately, without exception. No “soft expiry,” no automatic extension, no grace period unless constitutionally defined and itself governed.

TNC-06  Conflict Disclosure Prerequisite
        No actor may participate in deliberation or voting without completing conflict disclosure for that specific Decision Object. System blocks participation — not merely warns — until disclosure complete.

TNC-07  Quorum Enforcement Before Vote Initiation
        Votes cannot be initiated, recorded, or tallied without verified quorum. System does not permit “we’ll verify quorum later” or “quorum was probably met.”

TNC-08  Decision Object Immutability After Terminal Status
        Once a Decision Object reaches terminal status (APPROVED, REJECTED, VOID), its record is immutable. Corrections, amendments, or reversals create new linked Decision Objects — they never modify the original. The original record is historical truth.

TNC-09  AI Agent Delegation Ceiling
        AI agents cannot hold authority exceeding what is explicitly delegated, cannot delegate to others, cannot modify their own authority scope. Any attempt is a security incident, not a feature request.

TNC-10  Emergency Action Ratification Tracking
        Every emergency action automatically generates a ratification requirement. System tracks ratification status and escalates unratified emergency actions. Routine unratified emergency authority is a governance failure that the system surfaces, not hides.
