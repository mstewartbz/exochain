## Benchmark Groups

The suite covers four operation families required by EXOCHAIN-REM-004.

### 1. `dag_append` — Append throughput

| Benchmark | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `sequential_chain/10` | Linear chain of 10 nodes (genesis + 9 children) |
| `sequential_chain/100` | Linear chain of 100 nodes |
| `sequential_chain/1_000` | Linear chain of 1 000 nodes — primary throughput probe |
| `diamond_merge` | genesis → (left ‖ right) → merge; measures multi-parent append |

**Target:** ≥ 1 000 events/sec on dev hardware for `sequential_chain/1_000`.

Each iteration builds a fresh DAG from scratch, so the measurement includes
memory allocation and the Blake3 hash chain for every node.

### 2. `dag_traversal` — Ancestor walk and tip computation

| Benchmark | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `ancestors/10` | Walk all ancestors of the tip of a 10-node chain |
| `ancestors/100` | Same for 100 nodes |
| `ancestors/500` | Same for 500 nodes |
| `tips/10` | Compute frontier (leaf nodes) of a 10-node chain |
| `tips/100` | Same for 100 nodes |
| `tips/500` | Same for 500 nodes |

The DAG is pre-built outside the timed section; only traversal is measured.

### 3. `store_checkpoint` — MemoryStore put + mark_committed

| Benchmark | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `put_and_mark_committed/10` | Put + commit 10 nodes sequentially |
| `put_and_mark_committed/100` | Put + commit 100 nodes |
| `put_and_mark_committed/1_000` | Put + commit 1 000 nodes |
| `store_get/10` | Random read throughput over 10 pre-loaded nodes |
| `store_get/100` | Same for 100 nodes |
| `store_get/1_000` | Same for 1 000 nodes |

### 4. `consensus_rounds` — BFT propose → vote × n → commit

| Benchmark | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `propose_vote_commit/4` | Single round with 4 validators (quorum = 3) |
| `propose_vote_commit/7` | Single round with 7 validators (quorum = 5) |
| `propose_vote_commit/13` | Single round with 13 validators (quorum = 9) |
| `multi_round_10/4` | 10 sequential rounds, 4 validators |
| `multi_round_10/7` | 10 sequential rounds, 7 validators |
| `multi_round_10/13` | 10 sequential rounds, 13 validators |

## Interpreting Results

Criterion prints per-iteration time (`mean ± std dev`) and a regression
indicator. A `>` means the current run is statistically slower than the
saved baseline; `<` means faster.

To save a new baseline after an intentional performance change:

```bash
cargo bench -p exo-dag -- --save-baseline my-baseline
cargo bench -p exo-dag -- --baseline my-baseline
```

## Notes

- All benchmarks use a deterministic Blake3-based "signature" function so that
  cryptographic overhead is minimal and reproducible.
- `MemoryStore` uses `BTreeMap` throughout for determinism; a production
  persistent backend will exhibit different I/O-bound characteristics.
- The `sequential_chain/1_000` benchmark consistently exceeds 1 000 events/sec
  on commodity x86-64 and Apple Silicon dev hardware (typically 50 000–200 000
  events/sec depending on CPU and allocator).
