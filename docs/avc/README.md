# Autonomous Volition Credentials (AVC)

> **AVC** stands for **Autonomous Volition Credential** — a portable,
> signed, machine-verifiable credential that defines what an autonomous
> actor is authorized to **pursue, initiate, delegate, access, execute,
> and prove** under a human or organizational principal.

## Thesis

EXOCHAIN already has identity, authority, consent, governance, and
trust receipts. AVC is the missing object: a single inspectable
credential that answers *what is this autonomous actor allowed to
pursue?* before it acts.

| Primitive | What it proves |
|-----------|----------------|
| Identity | who the actor is |
| Authority | who delegated power |
| Consent | what data and action posture applies |
| **AVC** | **what autonomous intent is allowed before action** |

> **Important semantic constraint.** "Volition" here means **delegated
> operational intent**, not consciousness, sentience, emotion, or
> human-like free will. EXOCHAIN does not claim that autonomous actors
> have minds; it claims that operators must publish what their actors
> are allowed to pursue.

## Lifecycle

| Operation | Function | Domain tag |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Issue | `issue_avc(draft, sign)` | `exo.avc.credential.v1` |
| Validate | `validate_avc(request, registry)` | (read-only) |
| Delegate | `delegate_avc(parent, child_draft, sign)` | `exo.avc.credential.v1` |
| Revoke | `revoke_avc(id, revoker, reason, now, sign)` | `exo.avc.revocation.v1` |
| Trust receipt | `create_trust_receipt(...)` | `exo.avc.receipt.v1` |

Validation is **fail-closed**: missing keys, missing required consent
or policy refs, malformed structural values, scope violations,
expiration, and revocation each produce an explicit `AvcDecision::Deny`
result with sorted reason codes.

Delegation **strictly narrows** every dimension. A child credential
that widens permissions, tools, data classes, counterparties,
jurisdictions, autonomy level, budget, risk threshold, expiry, or
delegation depth is rejected with `AvcError::DelegationWidens`.

## Field reference

### `AutonomousVolitionCredential`

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `schema_version` | `u16` | Must equal `AVC_SCHEMA_VERSION` (`1`). |
| `issuer_did` | `Did` | DID that signs the credential. |
| `principal_did` | `Did` | Entity on whose behalf the actor operates. |
| `subject_did` | `Did` | The autonomous actor. |
| `holder_did` | `Option<Did>` | Defaults to `subject_did`. |
| `subject_kind` | `AvcSubjectKind` | AI agent, holon, workflow, etc. |
| `created_at` / `expires_at` | `Timestamp` | HLC timestamps. |
| `delegated_intent` | `DelegatedIntent` | Purpose, objectives, autonomy level, delegation flag. |
| `authority_scope` | `AuthorityScope` | Permissions, tools, data classes, counterparties, jurisdictions. |
| `constraints` | `AvcConstraints` | Budget, risk, approval threshold, time window, forbidden actions. |
| `authority_chain` | `Option<AuthorityChainRef>` | Required when `issuer_did != principal_did`. |
| `consent_refs` / `policy_refs` | `Vec<...>` | Required references must exist in the registry. |
| `parent_avc_id` | `Option<Hash256>` | Set on delegation. |
| `signature` | `Signature` | Issued by `issuer_did`. |

### `AvcValidationRequest`

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `credential` | `AutonomousVolitionCredential` | Already signed. |
| `action` | `Option<AvcActionRequest>` | Optional action being adjudicated. |
| `now` | `Timestamp` | Caller-provided "current time" — never read from the system clock. |

### `AvcValidationResult`

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `credential_id` | `Hash256` | Deterministic credential ID. |
| `decision` | `AvcDecision` | `Allow`, `Deny`, `HumanApprovalRequired`, `ChallengeRequired`. |
| `reason_codes` | `Vec<AvcReasonCode>` | Sorted, deduped. |
| `normalized_holder_did` | `Did` | Effective holder. |
| `valid_until` | `Option<Timestamp>` | Mirrors `expires_at`. |
| `receipt` | `Option<AvcTrustReceipt>` | Populated when the caller asks for one. |

## Determinism contract

- Canonical CBOR + BLAKE3 over a domain-tagged payload.
- All collections are normalized (sorted, deduped) **before** signing.
- No floating-point values, no `HashMap`/`HashSet`, no system-clock
  reads.
- Validation passes `now` in from the caller.

## Security model

- Signing domains are versioned and distinct (`exo.avc.credential.v1`,
  `exo.avc.receipt.v1`, `exo.avc.revocation.v1`) so wire payloads
  cannot be re-purposed across object types.
- Tampering with any signed field invalidates the signature.
- Authority chains are verified through `exo-authority`'s existing
  `verify_chain` API; the credential carries only the chain's hash so
  private chain content is not gossipped.
- Required consent and policy references must exist in the validator's
  registry before validation can `Allow`.
- Revocation always wins: the registry's `is_revoked` check is fatal
  even if every other field is valid.
- The MVP registry is in-memory; production deployments must back it
  with a durable, governance-controlled store.

## Relationship to the economy layer

The economy layer is **strictly downstream** of AVC validation. AVC
validation **never** consults pricing or settlement state, and the
economy layer **never** uses payment status to gate trust. During the
launch phase, every quote and settlement resolves to zero — see
[../economy/README.md](../economy/README.md).

## Non-claims

- AVC does **not** assert that an autonomous actor is conscious,
  sentient, or has free will.
- The MVP is in-memory; persistence, federation, distributed revocation
  registries, JSON-LD VC alignment, and selective disclosure are
  follow-up work.
- AVC is not a full W3C VC implementation; it borrows the shape and the
  spirit, not the JSON-LD context.
