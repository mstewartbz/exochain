# Production Deployment Guide

This guide covers deploying the EXOCHAIN gateway to a production-like environment
with a live PostgreSQL database and the `production-db` feature enabled.

---

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Minimum version | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Rust toolchain | 1.85 (MSRV) | Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) |
| Docker | 24+ | For Postgres and container builds |
| Docker Compose | v2 plugin | `docker compose` (not `docker-compose`) |
| PostgreSQL | 14+ | Hosted or self-managed; 16-alpine recommended |
| sqlx-cli | latest | `cargo install sqlx-cli --no-default-features --features postgres,rustls` |

---

## Docker Compose Setup

The repository ships `docker-compose.yml` for local development.  For production
or staging, create your own `docker-compose.prod.yml` along the following lines:

```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: exochain
      POSTGRES_USER: exochain
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}"   # inject from env or secrets
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U exochain -d exochain"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 12
      start_period: 10s

  exochain-gateway:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: "postgres://exochain:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@postgres:5432/exochain"
      BIND_ADDRESS: "0.0.0.0:8080"
      LOG_LEVEL: info
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  pgdata:
```

Start the stack:

```bash
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<your-secret> docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

---

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes (production) | — | `postgres://<user>:<pass>@<host>:<port>/<db>` |
| `BIND_ADDRESS` | No | `127.0.0.1:8443` | Host and port the gateway listens on |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | No | `info` | Tracing filter: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |

`DATABASE_URL` follows the standard PostgreSQL connection URI format.  Example:

```
postgres://exochain:secret@localhost:5432/exochain
```

---

## Running Migrations

Migrations live in `crates/exo-gateway/migrations/` and are managed by
[sqlx-migrate](https://docs.rs/sqlx/latest/sqlx/macro.migrate.html).

Apply all pending migrations against your database:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL="postgres://exochain:secret@localhost:5432/exochain"
sqlx migrate run --source crates/exo-gateway/migrations
```

Migrations are also applied automatically at startup when the gateway is
compiled with the `production-db` feature and `DATABASE_URL` is set, via the
`db::init_pool` function.

To inspect applied migrations:

```bash
sqlx migrate info --source crates/exo-gateway/migrations
```

---

## Feature Flags

### `production-db`

The gateway ships with a **WO-009 deny-all scaffold** as the default
adjudication context.  This means every adjudication request is denied until a
live database is configured — a safe default for development and testing.

Enable the production DB resolver by compiling with the `production-db` Cargo
feature:

```bash
cargo build --release --features exo-gateway/production-db
```

Or in Docker (add to `Dockerfile` build args / `ENV`):

```dockerfile
RUN cargo build --release --features exo-gateway/production-db
```

**When to enable**: only when `DATABASE_URL` points to a fully-migrated
PostgreSQL instance with `agent_roles`, `consent_records`, and
`authority_chains` tables populated.  Without populated adjudication tables the
DB resolver returns the same deny-all context as the scaffold.

**When NOT to enable**: local development without Docker, CI unit-test jobs
(Gates 1–12), or environments where you intentionally want deny-all behavior.

---

## Health Checks

The gateway exposes two health endpoints:

### `GET /health`

Always returns `200 OK` with basic version and uptime information.  Use this
as the liveness probe in Kubernetes / Docker Compose.

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8080/health | jq .
# {"status":"ok","version":"0.1.0-alpha","uptime_seconds":42}
```

### `GET /ready`

Returns `200 OK` when the PostgreSQL pool is reachable, `503 Service
Unavailable` otherwise.  Use as the readiness probe.

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:8080/ready
# 200  (DB reachable)
# 503  (DB unavailable or DATABASE_URL not configured)
```

Docker Compose readiness example:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -sf http://localhost:8080/ready || exit 1"]
  interval: 10s
  timeout: 5s
  retries: 6
  start_period: 15s
```

---

## Smoke Test

Once the stack is running and migrations are applied, verify end-to-end
operation by registering a DID:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "did:exo:smoke-test-001",
    "public_key": "ed25519:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=",
    "created_at": 0
  }' | jq .
# {"did":"did:exo:smoke-test-001","status":"registered"}
```

A `201 Created` response confirms the gateway is accepting requests and writing
to the DID registry.  A `503` on `/ready` or a `500` here indicates a database
connectivity problem — check `DATABASE_URL` and that migrations have run.
