**Assessment date**: 2026-03-20
**Assessed by**: Repository audit
**Methodology**: Code inspection, documentation review, CI artifact review

## Crosswalk Table

| Policy Area | Current EXOCHAIN Capability | Evidence | Status | Recommended Next Step | Owner | Notes / Caveats |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Protecting Children and Empowering Parents** | No age-assurance or parental-control features implemented | N/A | **Gap** | Define `AgeAssuranceHook` extension interface in `exo-identity`; document parental-control policy surface in `exo-consent` | Identity / Legal panels | EXOCHAIN is an infrastructure substrate, not a consumer-facing application. Child safety controls would be implemented by downstream applications using EXOCHAIN's consent and identity primitives. |
| **Safeguarding and Strengthening American Communities** | Constitutional governance framework with human oversight invariant; escalation workflows; audit trail | `crates/exo-governance/`, `crates/exo-escalation/`, `HumanOversight` invariant | **Architectural Affordance** | Document community safety extension surfaces; add ADR for content moderation hook | Governance / Security panels | The governance framework provides infrastructure for community safeguarding rules but does not implement specific content moderation or community safety features. |
| **Respecting Intellectual Property Rights and Supporting Creators** | Provenance tracking via DAG; audit trail with HLC timestamps; cryptographic evidence chain | `crates/exo-dag/`, `crates/exo-legal/`, `exo-core::events` | **Architectural Affordance** | Define `CreatorRightsEvidence` intake flow; document provenance chain as IP attribution surface | Legal / Architecture panels | The immutable DAG and provenance chain provide infrastructure for IP attribution and evidence, but no creator-specific workflows exist. |
| **Preventing Censorship and Protecting Free Speech** | No censorship or content filtering implemented; governance is purely structural | Constitutional governance model; `ConflictAdjudication` invariant; contestation mechanism | **Architectural Affordance** | Document the contestation mechanism as a redress pathway; add ADR for user appeal flow | Governance / Legal panels | EXOCHAIN's governance model inherently supports contestation and appeal via the BCTS lifecycle and escalation workflows. No content-level censorship exists. |
| **Enabling Innovation and Ensuring American AI Dominance** | Open-source constitutional governance substrate; Apache-2.0 license; extensible via MCP rules and Syntaxis workflows | `LICENSE` (Apache-2.0), `crates/exo-gatekeeper/src/mcp.rs`, ExoForge integration | **Partial** | Publish first release to crates.io; improve developer onboarding; add sandbox/playground mode | Architecture / Operations panels | The open-source, composable design supports innovation. First release and improved documentation will lower the barrier to adoption. |
| **Educating Americans and Developing an AI-Ready Workforce** | Demo platform with 23 widgets, AI help menus, and contextual documentation | `demo/web/`, AI help context per widget, `docs/` | **Partial** | Add tutorial workflows; create learning-path documentation; document ExoForge as an AI development teaching tool | Operations panel | The demo platform with embedded AI help provides educational value but is not specifically designed as a workforce training tool. |
| **Establishing a Federal Policy Framework** | Constitutional governance model with 8 invariants, 10 TNC controls, 5-panel council review | `EXOCHAIN_Specification_v2.2.pdf`, governance artifacts, `deny.toml`, CI quality gates | **Implemented (Framework Level)** | Map EXOCHAIN invariants to specific regulatory requirements as they are published; add ADR for regulatory sandbox mode | Governance / Legal panels | EXOCHAIN provides a governance framework that can encode and enforce policy. It does not implement specific federal regulations but provides the substrate for doing so. |
| **Preemption / Minimally Burdensome National Standard** | Multi-tenant architecture with per-tenant governance configuration | `crates/exo-tenant/`, `exo-governance` per-tenant constitution | **Architectural Affordance** | Document multi-jurisdiction governance configuration; add test cases for overlapping policy domains | Legal / Operations panels | The multi-tenant design allows different governance configurations per jurisdiction, supporting a minimally burdensome approach where tenants configure only applicable rules. |

## Extension Surfaces (Not Yet Implemented)

The following are documented as future control surfaces. They are **not implemented** in code but are architecturally supported by EXOCHAIN's design:

### 1. Age-Assurance Integration Hook

**Where**: `crates/exo-identity/`
**Design**: Add an `AgeAssurance` trait and `AgeVerification` type to the identity crate. Downstream applications would implement age verification via the identity verification flow, gating consent operations for minors through the `exo-consent` bailment system.
**Status**: Not implemented. Requires ADR.

### 2. Parental-Control Policy Hook

**Where**: `crates/exo-consent/`
**Design**: Extend the consent policy system with a `ParentalConsentPolicy` that requires guardian DID authorization for subjects below a configurable age threshold.
**Status**: Not implemented. Requires ADR.

### 3. Digital Replica Complaint/Intake Flow

**Where**: `crates/exo-legal/`
**Design**: Add a `DigitalReplicaComplaint` type and intake workflow that creates a governed BCTS decision for adjudication of unauthorized digital replicas.
**Status**: Not implemented. Requires ADR.

### 4. Creator-Rights Evidence Intake

**Where**: `crates/exo-legal/`, `crates/exo-dag/`
**Design**: Leverage the existing provenance DAG to record timestamped evidence of creator attribution. Add a `CreatorEvidence` event type that anchors IP claims in the immutable ledger.
**Status**: Not implemented. Existing DAG provides the infrastructure.

### 5. User Redress and Appeal Pathway

**Where**: `crates/exo-escalation/`
**Design**: The escalation and contestation mechanisms already provide the infrastructure for appeal workflows. A dedicated `UserRedress` flow would formalize the pathway from complaint to council review to resolution.
**Status**: Partially supported by existing escalation primitives. Full flow not implemented.

### 6. Regulatory Sandbox Mode

**Where**: `crates/exo-tenant/`, `crates/exo-governance/`
**Design**: Add a `SandboxTenant` configuration that relaxes certain governance constraints for testing and evaluation purposes, with clear labeling and audit trail entries marking all actions as sandbox-mode.
**Status**: Not implemented. Multi-tenant architecture provides the foundation.

### 7. Workforce/Education Onboarding

**Where**: `demo/web/`, `docs/`
**Design**: The demo platform's widget grid and AI help system provide a foundation for educational onboarding. Structured learning paths would guide users through governance concepts using the interactive configurator.
**Status**: Demo platform exists. Structured learning paths not yet created.

## Summary

| Status | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Implemented (Framework Level) | 1 |
| Partial | 2 |
| Architectural Affordance | 4 |
| Gap | 1 |

EXOCHAIN is an infrastructure substrate, not a consumer-facing application. Most policy areas are addressed at the architectural level — EXOCHAIN provides the governance primitives (consent, identity, audit, escalation, multi-tenancy) that downstream applications use to implement specific policy requirements. Where gaps exist, extension surfaces are documented above with recommended ADRs.
