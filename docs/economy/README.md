# EXOCHAIN Custody-Native Economy

> **EXOCHAIN is chain-of-custody for autonomous execution.** The economy
> layer prices economically-consequential autonomous activity. During
> the **launch phase, every active price resolves to zero** so trust is
> never paywalled. The full quote → settle → receipt mechanism still
> runs end-to-end, ready for governance to flip nonzero pricing on later
> without changing this surface.

## Zero-pricing guarantee (launch phase)

For every event class, every actor class, every assurance class, and
every input — including adversarial maxima — the launch policy returns:

- `charged_amount_micro_exo == 0`
- every field in `PriceBreakdown` is `0`
- every `RevenueShareLine.amount_micro_exo` is `0`
- a populated, explicit `ZeroFeeReason`

This is not a special case in `quote()`. It is the structural
consequence of [`PricingPolicy::zero_launch_default`]: every active
rate, multiplier, vigorish, share basis-point bonus, floor, and ceiling
is `0`, and the integer-only price formula clamps to the `[floor,
ceiling]` window.

> **AVC validation is independent of pricing.** AVC validity does not
> change with quote, settlement, or payment state. The two layers are
> wired through receipts (audit) — never through gating.

## Routes

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `POST` | `/api/v1/economy/quote` | Build a `SettlementQuote` from `PricingInputs`. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/economy/settle` | Settle a quote into a `SettlementReceipt`. |
| `GET`  | `/api/v1/economy/receipts/:id` | Fetch a stored settlement receipt. |
| `GET`  | `/api/v1/economy/policy/active` | Inspect the active `PricingPolicy`. |

POSTs inherit the node's bearer-auth write guard; reads are public.

## Future activation

Switching the launch phase off is a **policy** change, not a code
change. A governance proposal can set:

- nonzero `compute_unit_price_micro_exo`, `storage_byte_price_micro_exo`,
  `verification_op_price_micro_exo`
- nonzero `protocol_vig_bp`, `value_share_bp`, `risk_share_bp`
- nonzero `global_ceiling_micro_exo`
- non-neutral actor / event / assurance multipliers
- richer revenue-share templates per event class

The deterministic formula in
[`compute_breakdown`](../../crates/exo-economy/src/price.rs) immediately
starts producing nonzero outputs. AVC validity, identity, consent,
authority, and governance behavior are unchanged.

## Determinism contract

- Integer-only (`MicroExo = u128`, `BasisPoints = u32`).
- Saturating arithmetic prevents overflow under adversarial inputs.
- All hashing is BLAKE3 over canonical CBOR with versioned domain tags
  (`exo.economy.quote.v1`, `exo.economy.settlement_receipt.v1`,
  `exo.economy.policy.v1`).
- Settlement receipts form a per-store hash chain via
  `prev_settlement_receipt`.
- No floats. No unordered collections. No system clock.

## Non-claims

- This MVP does not implement a token launch, fiat rails, external
  exchanges, or ML-driven pricing.
- The store is in-memory; persistence is a follow-up PR.
- Adaptive multipliers and revenue-share templates are present
  structurally but resolve to neutral / zero values during the launch
  phase.
