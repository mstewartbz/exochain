//! SDK error types.
//!
//! All SDK operations that can fail return [`ExoResult<T>`], which is an alias
//! for [`std::result::Result<T, ExoError>`]. Each variant narrows the error to
//! a specific subsystem to aid programmatic handling — callers can
//! `match` on the variant rather than parsing the error string.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use exochain_sdk::consent::BailmentBuilder;
//! use exochain_sdk::error::ExoError;
//! use exo_core::Did;
//!
//! let a = Did::new("did:exo:a").expect("valid");
//! let b = Did::new("did:exo:b").expect("valid");
//! let err = BailmentBuilder::new(a, b).build().unwrap_err();
//! assert!(matches!(err, ExoError::Consent(_)));
//! ```
