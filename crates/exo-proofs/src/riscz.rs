//! Real (vendored) RISC Zero receipt verifier — VCG-001c artifact.
//!
//! [`Risc0Groth16Verifier`] is a concrete [`crate::envelope::RiscZeroReceiptVerifier`]
//! implementation backed by the actual, vendored `risc0-zkvm` crate (verifier-only:
//! `default-features = false, features = ["std"]` — no prover, no client API, no
//! Bonsai remote-proving surface). It exists as a **reviewable artifact**, frozen
//! for external cryptographic review (ratified decision D1, `GAP-REGISTRY.md`
//! VCG-001).
//!
//! ## This type is NOT wired into production verification
//!
//! [`ProofEnvelope::verify`](crate::envelope::ProofEnvelope::verify) continues to
//! call [`FailClosedRiscZeroVerifier`](crate::envelope::FailClosedRiscZeroVerifier)
//! exclusively, and [`crate::envelope::default_registry`] continues to register
//! [`crate::envelope::BackendId::RiscZero`] as
//! [`crate::envelope::AuditStatus::PendingExternalReview`] (never
//! `ProductionReviewed`). Swapping this verifier into the seam — and promoting the
//! registry entry — is a separate, later change (O-1.6) that must not happen
//! before external cryptographic review of this code lands. Until then this module
//! is dead-code-linted-safe (kept `pub`) but otherwise inert.
//!
//! ## Verification contract
//!
//! [`Risc0Groth16Verifier::verify_receipt`] performs, in order:
//!
//! 1. **Decode**: deserialize `receipt_bytes` as canonical CBOR
//!    ([`ciborium`], matching this crate's canonical-CBOR-not-JSON convention;
//!    see `src/verifier.rs`) into a risc0 [`Receipt`]. Malformed bytes → `Err`.
//! 2. **Parse image id**: convert `image_id_or_verifier_key` into a risc0
//!    [`Digest`] (exactly 32 bytes). Wrong length → `Err`.
//! 3. **Cryptographic verify**: call `receipt.verify(image_id)`, which checks
//!    the wrapped seal (Groth16 or otherwise, per risc0's `InnerReceipt`
//!    dispatch) against the image id and confirms successful guest exit.
//!    Failure → `Err`.
//! 4. **Journal binding** (objective O-1.1): BLAKE3-hash the receipt's
//!    `journal.bytes` and require it equal `journal_digest` exactly — this is
//!    the contract that binds a receipt to one, and only one, envelope
//!    context, so a receipt proven for one (statement, roots, domain) can
//!    never be replayed as valid under another. Mismatch → `Err`.
//!
//! Only if all four steps succeed does this return `Ok(true)`. Every other
//! path returns `Err`, never `Ok(false)` — mirroring this crate's existing
//! fail-closed convention (see [`FailClosedRiscZeroVerifier`](crate::envelope::FailClosedRiscZeroVerifier)).

    //! ships raw `ark-groth16` proof/vk/public-input JSON fixtures under
    //! `tests/data/`, but those are not a serialized `risc0_zkvm::Receipt`
    //! and wrapping them into one is exactly the `prove`-only surface this
    //! seam avoids). A happy-path test is therefore deferred to a follow-up
    //! that lands a committed real-receipt fixture (see the `#[ignore]`d stub
    //! below) rather than faked here.
