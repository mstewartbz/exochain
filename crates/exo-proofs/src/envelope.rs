//! Versioned proof statement registry and proof envelope.
//!
//! Lane VCG-001a (see `GAP-REGISTRY.md` "VCG-001 - Production ZK Proof Backend
//! Absent", remediation track: "Define a versioned proof statement registry
//! covering governance compliance, DAG inclusion, execution receipt, model
//! inference, and compatibility-only pedagogical proofs.").
//!
//! [`ProofEnvelope`] binds together everything a verifier needs to know
//! *about* a proof before it ever looks at proof bytes: which kind of
//! statement is being proven ([`ProofStatementKind`]), which backend
//! produced it ([`BackendId`]), an envelope format version, the public
//! inputs, commitment roots, the verifier key or image id, and a domain
//! separator binding the proof to its intended context.
//!
//! ## Fail-closed backend registry
//!
//! [`BackendId`] is a closed set of *known* backends plus an
//! [`BackendId::Unknown`] catch-all for any numeric id that does not match a
//! known variant. [`ProofEnvelope::validate_backend`] refuses
//! `BackendId::Unknown` unconditionally — an envelope naming an
//! unrecognized or future backend id can never validate. This is the same
//! "never stub, fail loudly" doctrine that governs the rest of this crate
//! (see the crate-root docs and [`crate::guard_unaudited`]).
//!
//! ## Unaudited backend gating
//!
//! The only backend currently registered is
//! [`UNAUDITED_BLAKE3_STANDIN_BACKEND_ID`] — the same blake3 "stand-in"
//! cryptography described in the crate-root docs. Wrapping that backend id
//! in an envelope does not exempt it from the crate's unaudited-refusal
//! doctrine: [`ProofEnvelope::verify`] refuses with
//! [`crate::error::ProofError::UnauditedImplementation`] unless the opt-in
//! `unaudited-pedagogical-proofs` Cargo feature is enabled, mirroring the
//! [`crate::guard_unaudited`] pattern used by `snark`, `stark`, and `zkml`.
//!
//! ## Wire format
//!
//! Per the crate's canonical-CBOR-not-JSON convention (see
//! `src/verifier.rs`), [`ProofEnvelope`] is (de)serialized with
//! [`ciborium`]'s canonical CBOR encoding, never JSON.
