# Formal Council Policy Spec: Advanced Neuro-Symbolic Governance

## 1. Core Doctrine
**"Trust (not latency) is the accelerator."**
The Exochain decision council relies on a multi-layered governance model ensuring that mathematical rigor and symbolic constitutional law are never superseded by probabilistic heuristics.

## 2. Architecture: The Tri-Layered Model
This policy enforces a balanced approach consisting of three distinct layers:
1. **Constitutional Inside (Symbolic Layer):** hard rules, TNCs, authority validations, quorum limits, ratification.
2. **Epistemic Engine (Bayesian Layer):** risk modeling, forecasting, evidence weighting, uncertainty measurement.
3. **Advisory Speed Layer (Neural Distillate):** optional proposal assistance trained on teacher-verified data.

## 3. Mandatory Requirements for Advanced Mode Claims
Every advanced-mode decision must carry:
- **Prior**
- **Evidence references** (URI or reproducible hash)
- **Posterior + confidence interval**
- **Symbolic rule trace hash**
- **Teacher/student disagreement score**
- **Human review status**
- **Policy version / threshold profile**

## 4. Hard Escalation and Abstention Thresholds (The Verifier Gate)
The current constitutional threshold profile is:
- **Minimum confidence interval:** `0.85`
- **Maximum sensitivity instability:** `0.10`
- **Maximum teacher/student disagreement:** `0.05`
- **Trace hash format:** 64 hex chars, optionally prefixed with `0x` or `sha256:`
- **Evidence references:** at least one entry, each either `http://`, `https://`, or a valid hash reference

If any of the above fail, `decision.forum` MUST reject or escalate the decision before approval.

## 5. Human Governance Requirements
- Advanced reasoning does **not** replace symbolic verification.
- Advanced reasoning does **not** replace human review.
- Policy and sovereignty decisions require explicit ratification before terminal approval.
- Humans must retain majority control over AI participants.

## 6. Recursive Fine-Tuning Constraints
Recursive supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is restricted to **teacher-verified, council-ratified** examples.

Important: this restriction is a **process/governance control**, not a runtime training-enforcement mechanism inside `decision.forum` itself.

## 7. Auditability
Every failed verifier-gate or TNC enforcement path must leave a structured audit event containing:
- timestamp
- event type
- reason
- escalation reason where applicable
- assessment snapshot where applicable

## 8. Documentation Integrity
Generated reports must not assert legal/evidentiary compliance unless the crate actually enforces it. Where full legal validation is out of scope, outputs must explicitly say review is still required.
