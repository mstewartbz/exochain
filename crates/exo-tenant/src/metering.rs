//! Tenant usage metering, billing export, and subscription state.
//!
//! Per ratified decision D7 (2026-07-02): metering lives in isolated
//! `exo-tenant`, never in `exo-economy`. Metering OBSERVES tenant activity
//! and never gates trust or isolation. Usage totals reconcile against the
//! actual [`crate::store::TenantStore`] state rather than an independently
//! tracked counter that can drift. Aggregation windows use HLC
//! [`exo_core::Timestamp`], never host wall-clock. Invoices are deterministic:
//! the same usage history always yields the same billing statement. Metering
//! NEVER triggers settlement or a charge by default — a tenant only settles
//! if a [`BillingPlan`] explicitly opts into paid settlement
//! (HonorGood zero-fee metrology).
