# EXOCHAIN — Rust crates

This directory is the authoritative home of the EXOCHAIN constitutional
governance fabric. Every feature of the fabric — identity, consent, authority
delegation, governance, kernel adjudication, DAG consensus, ZK proofs,
networking, tenancy, legal evidence, escalation — lives here as a workspace
crate.

Application developers should almost always start with
[`exochain-sdk`](./exochain-sdk/), which wraps the underlying crates behind a
single ergonomic API.

## Dependency layering

Crates are organized in roughly four tiers. Arrows point from a crate to
something it depends on.

```

Two façade crates sit on top of the whole stack:

- **`exochain-sdk`** — depends on `exo-core`, `exo-identity`, `exo-consent`,
  `exo-authority`, `exo-governance`, `exo-gatekeeper`, `exo-escalation`,
  `exo-legal`, `exo-dag`, and `exo-proofs`. This is the developer-facing
  entrypoint.
- **`exochain-wasm`** — depends on every `exo-*` crate plus `decision-forum`;
  compiles the full engine to WebAssembly for use from Node.js.

## Build and test

Run from the repository root:

```bash
# Build every crate.
cargo build --workspace

# Run all tests (unit + integration + doctests).
cargo test --workspace

# Doctests only.
cargo test --doc --workspace

# Clippy at workspace lint level.
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings

# Docs with broken-intra-doc-link enforcement.
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D rustdoc::broken-intra-doc-links" cargo doc --workspace --no-deps
```

The workspace `MSRV` and `edition` are set in the top-level `Cargo.toml` and
inherited by every crate.

## Non-Rust SDKs

The TypeScript and Python client SDKs — plus the precompiled WebAssembly
artifact — live in [`../packages`](../packages). See
[`../packages/README.md`](../packages/README.md) for which one to reach for.

## License

Each crate is licensed under **Apache-2.0**. See the top-level
[`LICENSE`](../LICENSE) for the full text.
