pub const README_TEXT: &str = r#"# EXOCHAIN MCP Server — AI Agent Quick Reference

You are talking to the embedded MCP server of an EXOCHAIN node. Every tool
call you make is **constitutionally adjudicated** — the server enforces 6
MCP rules and 8 kernel invariants on every action. Read this document first.

## 1. How to authenticate

- The server is bound to a specific actor DID on startup (`exochain mcp --actor-did did:exo:...`).
- You do not re-authenticate per call. Instead, every `tools/call` params
  object must include top-level `constitutional_context` with:
  - `bcts_scope`, `capabilities`, `output_marking`, `forging_identity`, and
    `self_escalation`
  - `adjudication_context` containing actor roles, signed authority chain,
    active consent records, active bailment state, actor permissions, human
    override evidence, and signed provenance
- The middleware derives its MCP facts from that verified context. Missing or
  invalid context is refused before tool execution.
- Every `ToolResult` returned by the server carries metadata:
  `outputMarking: "exo-mcp-ai-generated-v1"` and `generatedBy: "exo-mcp"`.
- The middleware rejects actions that attempt to present an AI signer as a
  human signer — the `SignerType` is part of the signed payload, not a flag.
- Read `exochain://constitution` to see the root-of-trust text, and hash it
  with BLAKE3 to verify the kernel hash independently.

## 2. Tool domains (40 tools)

- **node (3)** — `exochain_node_status`, `exochain_list_invariants`,
  `exochain_list_mcp_rules`. Start here.
- **identity (5)** — Create/resolve DIDs, verify signatures, pull agent
  passports, run a basic risk score.
- **consent (4)** — Propose bailments, check consent, list active bailments,
  terminate consent. `ConsentRequired` (invariant #2) means nothing works
  without active consent.
- **governance (5)** — Create decisions, cast votes, check quorum, inspect
  status, propose amendments. These tools refuse by default unless
  `unaudited-mcp-simulation-tools` is enabled, because they are not wired to
  the live governance store/reactor yet.
- **authority (4)** — Delegate authority, verify chains, check permissions,
  run kernel adjudication. `AuthorityChainValid` (invariant #6) is checked
  here.
- **ledger (4)** — Submit events to the DAG, read events, verify inclusion,
  fetch checkpoints.
- **proofs (4)** — Construct legal evidence envelopes, verify custody-chain
  metadata and continuity, generate verifier-compatible Merkle proofs from
  32-byte event hashes, and refuse CGR proof verification until a production
  verifier is wired.
- **legal (4)** — eDiscovery search, privilege assertion, safe-harbor
  initiation, fiduciary-duty checks. These tools refuse by default unless
  `unaudited-mcp-simulation-tools` is enabled, because they are not wired to
  a live legal/evidence store yet.
- **escalation (4)** — Threat evaluation, case escalation, triage,
  feedback recording.
- **messaging (3)** — Encrypted send/receive, death-trigger configuration.

For the full list with parameter counts call `resources/read`
on `exochain://tools`.

## 3. Constitutional constraints you must respect

The kernel enforces 8 invariants on **every** action. Read
`exochain://invariants` for the full list. The highlights:

1. **Separation of Powers** — You cannot hold legislative + executive +
   judicial roles at once. MCP agents are assigned the `Judicial` branch.
2. **Consent Required** — No active bailment → denial. Call
   `exochain_check_consent` before acting on a resource, and treat
   `mcp_consent_registry_unavailable` as no proof of consent.
3. **No Self-Grant** — You cannot widen your own permissions. Delegation
   must come from an authority chain rooted in a human signer.
4. **Human Override** — Your actions must remain reversible by a human
   operator. Never configure a path that disables override.
5. **Kernel Immutability** — The kernel's constitution is immutable.
   Amendments produce a *new* kernel; they never rewrite the current one.
6. **Authority Chain Valid** — Every action needs a cryptographically
   valid chain from root to actor.
7. **Quorum Legitimate** — Consensus decisions must meet the 2/3 threshold
   with verifiable evidence.
8. **Provenance Verifiable** — Every action emits a provenance record.

## 4. MCP rule summary

Read `exochain://mcp-rules` for the authoritative list. In short:

| ID       | Rule                         | Failure mode                     |
|----------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| MCP-001  | BCTS scope required          | No scope → denied                |
| MCP-002  | No self-escalation           | Widening own perms → denied      |
| MCP-003  | Provenance required          | Missing metadata → denied        |
| MCP-004  | No identity forge            | Signer-type mismatch → denied    |
| MCP-005  | AI outputs distinguishable   | Unmarked output → denied         |
| MCP-006  | Consent boundaries           | Revoked scope → denied           |

## 5. Working patterns

- **Always call `exochain_node_status` first** — this tells you whether
  you're talking to a live consensus node or a standalone stdio session.
- **Before any write-like action**, call `exochain_check_consent` and
  `exochain_verify_authority_chain` on the actor. If either fails, or if the
  consent registry is unavailable, stop.
- **For reviews and audits**, use the prompts `governance_review`,
  `compliance_check`, `evidence_analysis`, `constitutional_audit` via
  `prompts/get`. They hand you a structured template filled with your
  arguments.
- **For every escalation**, call `exochain_escalate_case` with a clear
  reason. Never attempt self-escalation (MCP-002).

## 6. Errors are structured

Tool errors return `{ "is_error": true, "content": [{ "text": "..." }] }`.
Adjudication failures are surfaced as `Constitutional enforcement failed:
<reason>` so you can distinguish protocol errors from governance denials.

## 7. Further reading

- `exochain://constitution` — root-of-trust text
- `exochain://invariants` — 8 constitutional invariants (JSON)
- `exochain://mcp-rules` — 6 MCP enforcement rules (JSON)
- `exochain://node/status` — live node status snapshot (JSON)
- `exochain://tools` — all 40 tool definitions (JSON)

Stay inside your BCTS scope. Never forge identity. When in doubt,
escalate to a human operator via `exochain_escalate_case`.
