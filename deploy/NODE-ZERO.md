# Node 0 — Genesis Deployment on Railway

## Overview

Node 0 is the **genesis node** of the EXOCHAIN network. It bootstraps the DAG, creates the first consensus round, and runs as the sole BFT validator until additional validators join. Railway provides managed Postgres, persistent volumes, GitHub-triggered deploys, and private networking — making it the fastest path from code to a live, persisted node.

This runbook gets Node 0 running from scratch. No prior Railway experience required.

---

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Railway account — sign up at [railway.com](https://railway.com)
- [ ] Railway CLI — `npm install -g @railway/cli`
- [ ] Railway authentication — `railway login` (opens browser)
- [ ] Git access to `github.com/exochain/exochain` (push to `main`)

---

## Step 1: Create Railway Project

```bash
railway init
```

When prompted:
- **Project name:** `exochain-node-0`
- **Link to existing repo:** select `github.com/exochain/exochain`

This creates the Railway project and links it to the repo. Pushes to `main` will trigger automatic deploys.

---

## Step 2: Add Postgres

```bash
railway add --database postgres
```

Railway provisions a Postgres 16 instance and automatically injects `DATABASE_URL` into your service environment over the private network. No manual connection string needed.

---

## Step 3: Add Persistent Volume

The node stores its SQLite DAG and identity key at `/data`. This volume **must** persist across restarts — losing it loses the chain.

**Via Railway dashboard:**
1. Project → `exochain` service → **Volumes** tab
2. **Add Volume** → Mount Path: `/data`

**Or via CLI:**
```bash
railway volume create exochain-data --mount-path /data
```

---

## Step 4: Set Environment Variables

```bash
railway variables set JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
railway variables set EXOCHAIN_DATA_DIR=/data
railway variables set RUST_LOG=info
railway variables set PORT=8080
# DATABASE_URL is injected automatically by the Postgres plugin
```

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes (auto) | Set by Railway Postgres plugin — private network URL |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Yes | 32+ byte random hex — JWT signing secret |
| `EXOCHAIN_DATA_DIR` | Yes | `/data` — persistent volume mount path |
| `RUST_LOG` | No | `info` for production; `debug` for troubleshooting |
| `PORT` | Yes | `8080` — HTTP API port (Railway also auto-sets this) |

---

## Step 5: Deploy

```bash
railway up
```

Railway builds the Dockerfile (multi-stage Rust + Node.js), starts the `exochain` binary, and runs the health check at `GET /health`. Build takes ~3–5 minutes on first run (Rust compile).

**Watch logs in real time:**
```bash
railway logs --tail
```

**What to look for:**
```
INFO exochain_node: Starting EXOCHAIN node
INFO exochain_node: Genesis block created
INFO exochain_node: Consensus reactor started (validator mode)
INFO exochain_node::network: Listening on 0.0.0.0:4001 (TCP) and 0.0.0.0:4002 (QUIC)
INFO exochain_node::api: HTTP API listening on 0.0.0.0:8080
```

---

## Step 6: Verify the Node is Live

```bash
# Open the Railway-assigned domain in your browser
railway open

# Or hit the health endpoint directly
curl https://<your-railway-domain>/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok","version":"..."}

# Check governance status
curl https://<your-railway-domain>/api/v1/governance/status
# Expected: {"consensus_round":0,"committed_height":0,"validator_count":1,"is_validator":true,...}
```

---

## Step 7: Run as Validator (Genesis Mode)

Node 0 must start as a BFT validator to bootstrap the network. The `--validator` flag in the start command enables this.

**Option A — Start command flag (recommended, already set in `railway.json`):**

The `railway.json` start command is:
```
./exochain start --data-dir /data
```

To run as a validator, update the start command:
```bash
railway variables set EXOCHAIN_VALIDATOR=true
```

Then update `railway.json` to pass `--validator`:
```json
"startCommand": "./exochain start --data-dir /data --validator"
```

Push to `main` — Railway auto-deploys.

**Option B — Override via Railway dashboard:**
Project → `exochain` service → Settings → **Start Command** → set to:
```
./exochain start --data-dir /data --validator
```

**CLI flags reference** (from `crates/exo-node/src/cli.rs`):

```
exochain start [OPTIONS]
  --api-port <PORT>         HTTP API port (default: 8080 via PORT env)
  --p2p-port <PORT>         P2P listen port (default: 4001)
  --data-dir <PATH>         Data directory (default: ~/.exochain)
  --validator               Run as BFT consensus validator
  --validators <DID,...>    Initial validator set DIDs (comma-separated)
                            If omitted, this node's DID is the sole validator
```

---

## Step 8: Verify DAG and Consensus State

```bash
# Check node status (requires running process in Railway)
railway run ./exochain status --data-dir /data
# Expected: height=0 (or 1 after genesis), peers=0 (standalone)

# Or via HTTP
curl https://<your-railway-domain>/api/v1/governance/status
```

Expected response when healthy:
```json
{
  "consensus_round": 1,
  "committed_height": 0,
  "validator_count": 1,
  "is_validator": true,
  "validators": ["did:exo:<node-0-did>"]
}
```

---

## Connecting a Second Node

Once Node 0 is running, additional nodes join via the `--seed` flag.

**Get Node 0's network address:**
```bash
# Railway assigns a public domain — use it as the seed on port 4001
# Example: exochain-node-0.up.railway.app:4001
```

**On Node 1 (different Railway project or service):**
```bash
exochain join \
  --seed exochain-node-0.up.railway.app:4001 \
  --data-dir /data \
  --validator
```

Or as a Railway start command:
```
./exochain join --seed <node-0-domain>:4001 --data-dir /data
```

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Build fails | `railway logs --build` — look for Rust compile errors |
| Node exits immediately | `railway logs` — verify `DATABASE_URL` is set and Postgres is healthy |
| `DATABASE_URL` not found | Re-run `railway add --database postgres` and redeploy |
| Volume not mounting | Confirm `/data` mount in Railway dashboard → Volumes tab |
| Health check failing | Node may still be starting; allow up to 5 minutes on cold boot |
| Port conflicts | Railway exposes one external port — always use `PORT` env var |
| Consensus stuck at round 0 | In standalone mode with `--validator`, rounds advance only when proposals are submitted |

**Useful commands:**
```bash
railway logs                    # tail live logs
railway logs --build            # build-time logs (Rust compile output)
railway status                  # service status
railway variables               # list all env vars
railway shell                   # open a shell in the running container
```

## What Node 0 Proves

This is the genesis deployment. Once running:

- **DAG is live** — persisting to SQLite at `/data/dag.db`
- **Postgres connected** — governance artifacts stored via `PostgresStore`
- **BFT consensus bootstrapped** — standalone validator mode, ready for quorum expansion
- **Identity key generated** — node DID is committed and stored at `/data/identity.key`
- **Chain of custody is mathematically provable** — regardless of Railway's availability, the DAG hashes are the truth

When Node 1 joins and quorum reaches 4 validators (3f+1 BFT safety), the network becomes fully fault-tolerant.

## Ports Reference

| Port | Protocol | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `8080` | HTTP | API (`/health`, `/api/v1/...`, dashboard) |
| `4001` | TCP | P2P peer connections |
| `4002` | UDP/QUIC | P2P QUIC transport |

Railway exposes port `8080` externally via the assigned domain. Ports `4001` and `4002` are accessible via Railway's private network or public TCP proxy (configure in service settings if needed for multi-node).
