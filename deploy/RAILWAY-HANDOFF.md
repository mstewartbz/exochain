# Node 0 Railway Deployment — Handoff

**Status:** Code is deployment-ready. Manual Railway CLI steps remain.

**Your Pro account capacity:** up to 42 replicas at 24 vCPU / 24 GB RAM each, 1 TB storage. Start small (recommend 1 replica, 2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM, 10 GB volume) and scale as load demands.

## Pre-flight: Code is ready

PR [#92](https://github.com/exochain/exochain/pull/92) merged to `main` — fixes:

1. Dockerfile builds the right binary (`exochain` + `exo-gateway`, not the missing `decision-forum-server`)
2. Rust version pinned to 1.85 (matches workspace)
3. Binary respects Railway's auto-injected `$PORT` env var
4. Dockerfile invokes `entrypoint.sh` (env-var driven, idiomatic)
5. `railway.json` no longer overrides start command (entrypoint runs)

Smoke-verified: `PORT=9999 exochain start` binds to 9999, `/health` returns `{"status":"ok"}`.

## What you need to do

### 1. Authenticate (one-time)

```bash
railway login
```

(Opens browser. The token in our chat is project-scoped read-only — insufficient for deploys. Use your account session.)

### 2. Link the existing project

```bash
cd /Users/bobstewart/dev/exochain
railway link --project ca52ac39-820a-488b-8f29-df17d76a9270
```

Choose `production` environment when prompted.

### 3. Add Postgres

```bash
railway add --database postgres
```

Railway provisions a Postgres 16 instance and auto-injects `DATABASE_URL` over the private network.

### 4. Add a service (the exochain node)

```bash
railway add --service exochain --repo exochain/exochain
```

Or link the local directory:
```bash
railway service create exochain
```

### 5. Set environment variables on the exochain service

```bash
railway variables --service exochain \
  --set "JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  --set "EXOCHAIN_DATA_DIR=/data" \
  --set "RUST_LOG=info" \
  --set "IS_VALIDATOR=true"
```

(`PORT` is auto-injected by Railway. `DATABASE_URL` is auto-injected by the Postgres plugin.)

### 6. Mount persistent volume at /data

**Via dashboard** (faster): Project → `exochain` service → **Volumes** → **+ Add Volume** → mount path `/data` → 10 GB.

**Or via CLI:**
```bash
railway volume create --service exochain --mount-path /data --size 10
```

### 7. Configure the custom domain

```bash
# Generate Railway-default domain first (for testing)
railway domain --service exochain

# Then add your custom domain
railway domain --service exochain --custom node.exochain.io
```

You'll get instructions to add a CNAME record at your DNS provider pointing `node.exochain.io` → `<railway-assigned>.up.railway.app`.

### 8. Configure TCP proxy on port 4001 (P2P)

```bash
railway tcp-proxy --service exochain --port 4001
```

This gives you a public TCP address like `roundhouse.proxy.rlwy.net:12345` that maps to the container's `4001`. Other nodes will use this as `--seed`.

### 9. Deploy

```bash
railway up
```

Or, since you'll have GitHub auto-deploy enabled (via dashboard → service → Settings → Source → GitHub), every merge to `main` triggers a deploy automatically. To do a one-off manual deploy:

```bash
railway redeploy --service exochain
```

### 10. Watch the logs

```bash
railway logs --service exochain
```

**Look for:**
```
INFO exochain: Node identity ready did=did:exo:...
INFO exochain: DAG store opened height=0
INFO exochain: Starting exochain node api_port=8080 p2p_port=4001 validator=true
INFO exochain: Consensus reactor started (validator mode)
INFO exochain: Dashboard at http://localhost:8080
```

### 11. Verify it's live

```bash
# Health
curl https://node.exochain.io/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok","version":"...","uptime_seconds":N}

# Governance status
curl https://node.exochain.io/api/v1/governance/status
# Expected: {"consensus_round":0,"committed_height":0,"validator_count":1,"is_validator":true,...}

# All 6 MCP resources via the embedded MCP server (if you also expose it)
# (See docs/guides/mcp-integration.md)
```

## CI/CD setup (Step E from your spec)

To wire ExoForge auto-deploy on `main`:

1. Dashboard → service `exochain` → **Settings** → **Source** → **Connect Repo**
2. Select `exochain/exochain` → branch `main`
3. Enable **Automatic Deployments**

Now every PR merged to `main` → Railway builds + deploys automatically.

For dev/stage/prod (your roadmap goal):
```bash
railway environment create staging
railway environment create development
```

Each environment gets its own Postgres + volume + URL. Promotion flow: branch `develop` → `staging` env → branch `main` → `production` env.

## What to monitor after first deploy

| Check | Frequency | Expected |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| `GET /health` | Every 30s (Railway healthcheck) | 200 OK |
| `GET /api/v1/governance/status` | Manual | `is_validator: true`, `consensus_round` increments slowly |
| Memory usage | Dashboard | <500 MB at idle, grows with DAG size |
| CPU | Dashboard | <5% at idle |
| Volume usage | Dashboard | DAG grows ~10 KB per event |
| Postgres connections | Dashboard | <10 typically |

## When you wake up: rotate the burned token

The `b30f...` token in our transcript is now compromised. Rotate it:

1. https://railway.com/account/tokens
2. Click **Revoke** on the token
3. Generate a new one if needed for ExoForge or other automation

---

## What's already in the code

- `Dockerfile` — multi-stage build (Rust 1.85 + Node 20), bundles entrypoint.sh
- `deploy/entrypoint.sh` — reads `IS_VALIDATOR`, `SEED_ADDR`, `EXOCHAIN_DATA_DIR`, `PORT`, `P2P_PORT`, `VALIDATORS`
- `railway.json` — Dockerfile builder, healthcheck `/health`, restart on failure
- `crates/exo-node/src/main.rs` — `Command::Start` and `Command::Join` honor `$PORT` env
