# Exochain to CyberMedica Integration Map

CyberMedica may integrate only with verified Exochain primitives through narrow adapters. This map is not a product architecture; it is a control surface for deciding what CyberMedica can build against after local Exochain truth commands and adapter tests pass.

## Integration Policy

| Rule | Requirement | Evidence basis |
|---|---|---|
| Adjacent surface boundary | CyberMedica is separate from Exochain core and cannot expand the trusted computing base by proximity. | `AGENTS.md` |
| Verified primitive only | Every Exochain-backed feature must cite source path, enabled runtime path, and test. | `AGENTS.md`, `docs/context/EXOCHAIN_CONTEXT_SEED_FOR_CYBERMEDICA.md` |
| No raw sensitive anchoring | Raw PHI, PII, sponsor-confidential, privileged, or source document content must not be written to immutable receipts, DAG payloads, external anchors, health endpoints, debug output, or telemetry. | `crates/exo-node/src/provenance.rs`, `crates/exo-legal/src/evidence.rs`, `AGENTS.md` |
| Baseline development required now | CyberMedica should develop domain models, service contracts, adapter interfaces, deterministic fixtures, contract tests, inactive trust-state UI, and fail-closed behavior before institutional root activation. | User clarification, `crates/exo-root/*` |
| Production trust activation gated | Root-backed production claims require verified root trust bundle after 13-certifier DKG and 7-of-13 signing. This gate does not block baseline development. | `crates/exo-root/src/ceremony.rs`, `dkg.rs`, `signing.rs`, `bundle.rs`, `portal.rs` |
| TDD bar | Implementation must be TDD-first with >90% scoped coverage and near-100% trust-boundary coverage. | User instruction, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `tools/test_coverage_policy.sh` |

## CyberMedica Need Mapping

Implementation stance: every row below may be developed now as a CyberMedica service contract with deterministic tests and inactive production trust state. The `Allowed Claim After Tests` column describes the claim that becomes available only after the named adapter/runtime/deployment evidence is present.

| CyberMedica Need | Exochain Primitive | Source Path | Adapter Needed? | MVP | Risk | Required Tests | Allowed Claim After Tests |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| Support access grants | Bailment type and consent gate access log | `crates/exo-consent/src/bailment.rs`, `gatekeeper.rs` | Yes | Yes | Break-glass can leak privileged data if not fail-closed. | grant required; reason required; revocation immediate; access log hash/sequence verified | audited support access |
| Evidence object hashing | Canonical CBOR hash, Hash256, Evidence | `crates/exo-core/src/hash.rs`, `crates/exo-core/src/types.rs`, `crates/exo-legal/src/evidence.rs` | Yes | Yes | Metadata can identify participant even without raw content. | same input same hash; changed input changed hash; raw PHI fixtures absent from anchor; evidence hash rejects zero | hash-backed evidence object |

## Primitives CyberMedica Must Avoid for Trust Claims Until Verified

| Primitive or Surface | Source path | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| ZK proofs | `crates/exo-proofs/src/lib.rs` | Explicitly unaudited, pedagogical, and default-off. |
| CrossChecked anchoring | `crates/exo-node/src/api.rs` | Default-off because proof URL/signature/tenant/authority verification is not established. |
| Raw admin governance | `crates/exo-node/src/api.rs` | Default refusal unless unaudited feature is enabled. |
| 0dentity device/behavior axes | `crates/exo-node/src/zerodentity/*` | Disabled behind unaudited feature flags. |
| Economy settlement | `crates/exo-economy/src/lib.rs` | Settlement scaffold with zero launch guarantee. |
| CommandBase enforcement | `command-base/*`, `AGENTS.md` | Adjacent surface not inventoried in this seed. |
| ExoForge/Archon as authority | `docs/guides/ARCHON-INTEGRATION.md`, `exoforge/*`, `.archon/*` | Process/tooling docs do not prove core enforcement. |

## Minimum Adapter Contract Tests

Every CyberMedica Exochain adapter must prove:

1. It fails closed when Exochain is unavailable, returns an error, times out, rejects auth, rejects consent, rejects authority, rejects quorum, or cannot create a receipt.
2. It cannot mint, cache, simulate, or override consent, authority, quorum, provenance, root authority, or Decision Forum outcomes outside Exochain enforcement.
3. It never writes raw PHI, PII, sponsor-confidential, privileged, or source document content into receipts, anchors, DAG payloads, telemetry, health, logs, debug endpoints, or exported diligence bundles.
4. It records operational database state separately from immutable Exochain receipts.
5. It includes source path, primitive, receipt path, test id, and PRD id for every trust claim.
6. It names the DAG DB gateway call path used for adjacent trust evidence and fails closed when that path is missing, simulated, cached, overridden, unavailable, or not bound to tenant and namespace.
