# Threat Model & Test Matrix

Based on Spec Section 13. Updated 2026-06-18 after DAG DB REST runtime activation evidence review.

**Status key:** 🟢 Implemented (tests passing) | 🟡 Partial or evidence pending | 🔴 Planned

## Threat Matrix

| ID | Threat | Mitigation (Code) | Crate(s) | Tests | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **T-01** | **Key Exfiltration** | `KeyStore` with `zeroize`-on-drop, key rotation, revocation, status tracking | `exo-identity/key_management.rs` | 15 unit | 🟢 Implemented |
| **T-02** | **Score Replay** | `verify_attestation()` validates attester key binding; `RiskAttestation` with subject DID, level, expiry | `exo-identity/risk.rs` | 8 unit | 🟢 Implemented |
| **T-03** | **BFT Liveness** | 2f+1 quorum via `quorum_size()`, `propose()`/`vote()`/`check_commit()`/`commit()` cycle, duplicate vote rejection, non-validator rejection | `exo-dag/consensus.rs` | 12 unit | 🟢 Implemented |
| **T-04** | **Sybil Attack** | 6 sub-threat taxonomy: `verify_independence()` checks signing keys, attestation chains, control metadata; `detect_coordination()` timing analysis (100ms threshold); independence-aware quorum counting | `exo-governance/crosscheck.rs`, `exo-governance/quorum.rs`, `exo-escalation/escalation.rs` | 11 + 12 + 10 unit | 🟢 Implemented |
| **T-05** | **Vault Breach** | `VaultEncryptor` with XChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD, HKDF-SHA256 key derivation, DID-bound associated data, zeroize-on-drop | `exo-identity/vault.rs` | 9 unit | 🟢 Implemented |
| **T-06** | **Eclipse Attack** | `RateLimiter` + `AsnPolicy` with min ASN diversity, `select_diverse_peers()` round-robin, `rotate_peers()` stale eviction, unknown ASN grouped as single bucket | `exo-api/p2p.rs` | 31 unit | 🟢 Implemented |
| **T-07** | **Replay (Events)** | `HybridClock` monotonic `now()`, causal `update()` merge, `ClockDrift` rejection, injectable wall clock for testing | `exo-core/hlc.rs` | 15 unit | 🟢 Implemented |
| **T-08** | **Sig Forgery** | Real `ed25519_dalek::VerifyingKey::verify()` in authority chain verification; `SignerType` prefix binding (human 0x01 / AI 0x02) in signed payload | `exo-core/crypto.rs`, `exo-authority/chain.rs`, `exo-gatekeeper/mcp.rs` | 10 + 5 adversarial | 🟢 Implemented |
| **T-09** | **HLC Manipulation** | `MAX_DRIFT_MS` (5000ms) enforcement, `ClockDrift` error on forward skew, monotonic guarantee on backward skew | `exo-core/hlc.rs` | 15 unit | 🟢 Implemented |
| **T-10** | **DoS API** | `RateLimiter` with per-peer counting (100 req cap), reset capability | `exo-api/p2p.rs` | 2 unit | 🟢 Implemented |
| **T-11** | **Admin Bypass** | CGR Kernel immutability (constitution hash verified on every `adjudicate()`), `SeparationOfPowers` invariant, `NoSelfGrant` invariant, `KernelImmutability` invariant | `exo-gatekeeper/kernel.rs`, `exo-gatekeeper/invariants.rs` | 14 + 30 unit | 🟢 Implemented |
| **T-12** | **Holon Key Theft** | TEE attestation with `TeeEnvironment` production gate; `Simulated` rejected in Production; `#[cfg(not(feature = "allow-simulated-tee"))]` compile-time strip; secure-by-default | `exo-gatekeeper/tee.rs` | 28 unit | 🟢 Implemented |
| **T-13** | **Capability Esc.** | CGR Kernel `adjudicate()` with `NoSelfGrant` invariant; authority chain scope narrowing; AI delegation ceiling (`TNC-09`) | `exo-gatekeeper/kernel.rs`, `exo-authority/chain.rs`, `decision-forum/tnc_enforcer.rs` | 14 + 19 + 13 unit | 🟢 Implemented |
| **T-14** | **Governance Monitor Poisoning** | Adversarial manipulation of continuous-governance monitoring output to trigger false-positive self-improvement cycles, potentially introducing malicious changes under cover of remediation. Sub-threats: (a) Unsigned findings injection — mitigated by requiring a BLAKE3/Ed25519 signed attestation envelope on all `POST /governance/health` payloads before storage (`exo-gatekeeper::governance_monitor::verify_attestation` exposed through `wasm_verify_governance_attestation`); (b) Automated AI->AI bypass — mitigated by human-DID approval gate (SignerType 0x01 required) via `ApprovalGate::approve()` before self-improvement cycle may begin implementation; (c) Circuit-breaker flooding — mitigated by `GovernanceCircuitBreaker` auto-pause when >3 Critical findings recorded within 24h; (d) Credential compromise — mitigated by `GOVERNANCE_API_TOKEN` bearer auth on all health endpoints + read-only ExoForge credential scoping per `exo-identity` key rotation policy. Detection signals: unexpected spike in Critical findings, governance score regression >=2 grades in one scan, self-improvement cycle triggered without matching approval record, audit chain break on health snapshot sequence. | `exo-gatekeeper/governance_monitor.rs`, `crates/exochain-wasm/src/gatekeeper_bindings.rs`, `demo/services/audit-api/src/index.js`, `demo/infra/postgres/init/003_governance_health.sql` | Rust attestation verification tests; WASM bridge valid/invalid attestation tests; audit API fail-closed tests for missing, mismatched, and rejected attestations | 🟢 Implemented |
| **T-15** | **Unratified Provenance Settlement** | A downstream surface or agent could attempt to convert recognition-only upstream provenance into economic settlement without accepted terms, ratification, materiality evidence, or authority. Mitigations: `LegacyReceipt` state machine rejects direct `Proposed -> Ratified`; Archon/Paperclip fixtures remain `Proposed` with `VoluntaryRecognitionOnly`; automated settlement requires accepted terms, valid authority envelope, active contribution node, active ruleset, sufficient legal effect, non-disputed materiality, and checked per-basis allocation. Opaque beneficiary references prevent sensitive payment or estate data from being placed on-ledger. | `exo-economy::legacy`, `exo-economy::honorgood`, `exo-economy::settlement` | module unit tests for state transitions, fixtures, automated settlement rejection, zero-launch settlement | 🟢 Implemented |
| **T-16** | **Adjacent Surface Settlement Claim** | CommandBase or ExoForge could imply EXOCHAIN settlement authority by proximity or create local settlement state during proposal/UI workflows. Mitigations: both surfaces have intake records; adapters fail closed when EXOCHAIN API configuration is absent; adapter responses state local settlement authority is false; CommandBase proxies to EXOCHAIN economy routes; ExoForge proposals stay unratified and submissions go to `/api/v1/economy/*`; TypeScript SDK and WASM bridge expose core routes/anchors without payment execution. | `command-base/app/services/honorgood-economy.js`, `command-base/app/routes/honorgood-economy.js`, `exoforge/lib/honorgood.js`, `exoforge/bin/exoforge-honorgood.js`, `packages/exochain-sdk/src/client.ts`, `crates/exochain-wasm/src/economy_bindings.rs` | adapter tests, SDK tests, WASM anchor tests | 🟢 Implemented |
| **T-17** | **DAG DB Governed Memory Writeback Bypass** | A DAG DB REST or MCP caller could try to persist or retrieve graph memory without tenant-scoped consent, actor provenance, or constitutional gate checks. Mitigations in this PR: the gateway router mounts exactly `POST /api/v1/dag-db/route`, `POST /api/v1/dag-db/context-packet`, `POST /api/v1/dag-db/writeback`, `POST /api/v1/dag-db/import`, and `POST /api/v1/dag-db/export`; intake, validate, trust-check, council decision, receipt lookup, catalog lookup, and route lookup are reserved DTO-only surfaces; default gateway/node builds include the `production-db` path; missing Postgres state, tenant authority, or write signatures fail closed instead of fabricating persistence; import/export are live only with distinct import/export consent plus route-bound signatures, and missing or mismatched consent/signatures fail closed. `DagDbGatekeeperService` enforces active bailment/consent, Ed25519 write signatures over canonical payload hashes, and the constructible invariant subset (`ConsentRequired`, `SeparationOfPowers`, `NoSelfGrant`, `HumanOverride`, `KernelImmutability`, `QuorumLegitimate`) before writeback persistence. RLS migration and transaction tenant binding are present; the MCP gateway proxy requires `dagdb-gateway-proxy` plus configured gateway auth and is configured proxy evidence, not an additional mounted REST surface. Final activation evidence is tracked in `docs/dagdb/runtime-activation/rollback-canary-observability.md`. | `crates/exo-gatekeeper/src/dagdb_gate.rs`, `crates/exo-gateway/src/dagdb.rs`, `crates/exo-dag-db-postgres/src/postgres/*`, `crates/exo-node/src/mcp/tools/dagdb.rs` | `dagdb_gate` consent/signature/invariant tests; `dagdb_routes_integration_contract`; `dagdb_cross_tenant_denies_every_get_and_post_route`; `writeback_authorizes_against_real_db_consent_and_identity_state`; `configured_gateway_proxies_all_dagdb_mcp_tools_with_auth_and_tenant_scope`; current PR-head evidence is supplied by PR checks and the PR body; local verification commands include `RUSTFLAGS='-D warnings' cargo test -p exochain-gateway dagdb --features production-db` and `RUSTFLAGS='-D warnings' cargo test -p exochain-dag-db-postgres --features postgres --test dagdb_tenant_rls_live_path_contract -- --nocapture`; scoped coverage claims must cite the exact producing command, package set, exclusions, numerator, and denominator | 🟢 Implemented |

## Resolved Remediation Tickets

All three remediation tickets have been resolved and closed:

- **#11 (T-05):** Resolved in commit `0371a4b` — VaultEncryptor with XChaCha20-Poly1305, HKDF-SHA256, AEAD binding to DID, zeroize-on-drop. 9 tests.
- **#12 (T-06):** Resolved in commit `0371a4b` — AsnPolicy with diversity enforcement, round-robin selection, stale peer rotation. 9 tests.
- **#13 (T-12):** Resolved in commit `0371a4b` — TeeEnvironment production gate, compile-time feature flag, secure-by-default. 9 tests.

## Security Policies

1. **Dependency Audit**: `cargo-deny` config (`deny.toml`) bans copyleft licenses, denies known vulnerabilities, bans OpenSSL (pure-Rust crypto only).
2. **Fuzzing**: Continuous fuzzing planned on `EventEnvelope` deserializers and signature verification inputs.
3. **No Unsafe**: `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` enforced across all crates.
4. **Determinism**: `#[deny(clippy::float_arithmetic)]` workspace-wide; `BTreeMap` only (no `HashMap`); HLC for all temporal ordering.
5. **Post-Quantum**: `Signature` enum supports `Ed25519`, `PostQuantum`, and `Hybrid` variants for migration readiness.
